## [Recruiting and Onboarding](<#recruiting-and-onboarding-(15-min)>) (15 min) {#recruiting-and-onboarding-(15-min)}

When recruiting, the goal is to find great people and attract them to your company. Since this is so important, you could rationalize throwing lots and lots of time at this problem, which most growing companies do. Unfortunately, this time-suck will grind most of your other functions to a halt.

The key is efficiency. And to be efficient, you must **spend as little time as possible with the candidates you don't hire (quick evaluation) and as much time as possible with the candidates you want to and do hire (building a relationship, onboarding/training).** Remember that each minute you spend with a candidate you don't hire is a minute that you aren't spending with the team member you want to hire.

Of all the recruiting systems I have seen, the best description is in the book _Who_ by Geoff Smart and Randy Street. I have summarized the [Recruiting System](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Mw1bOV14woAMGV7x_RI_yjWSuUa1aDDfDgL2M8Vg7sA/edit) in Appendix B. If this system resonates with you, I highly recommend reading the book _Who_ in its entirety to understand the details.

The key in this system is that predictive information does not come from the interviews themselves. There are plenty of people who are good at interviewing but do not perform in the job. Instead, the predictive information comes from how a person actually performs or how they have performed in the past.

If the person is not currently in a full-time job, hire them on a contract basis to work with you for 1-3 months. You will then see how they actually perform. This step is the most predictive information you can collect.

But most good people are already in a full-time job and are loathe to leave it unless they are offered another full-time job. For these people, the key is to collect information about how they have performed in previous jobs. And the best way to do that is through extensive reference interviews.

Therefore, the goal of the in-person interview becomes primarily to collect the names and contact of the people that the candidate has worked for and with throughout their career (top-grading interview). The hiring manager then uses this list to reach out to 5-7 people to conduct reference interviews. And this is where you discover the predictive information.

### **Before Recruiting**

As the hiring manager, write out a ninety-day roadmap for the position you need to fill. This roadmap includes all the goals you expect the new team member to hit within the first ninety days of joining. This action is critical for successful onboarding. During the interview process, share this roadmap with the candidate to make sure that she is excited about these goals.

### **Selling**

The best candidates will get offers from other companies. So, you need to not only evaluate but also sell from the very beginning.

#### **Building a relationship**

Just as in fundraising, [building a relationship](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BQOa7foLLxNXmGUhbvkzsvm0IVYOJZTFU4MKOmreCXc/edit) with a recruit will vastly increase her likelihood of joining your company. The best candidates can work anywhere. Make sure that they want to work with you.

Do this by using the same techniques mentioned earlier. Ask the candidate about herself, reflect on what she says, and remember what she said the next time you meet with her. If you have already used this method during your initial fundraising, you will know its effectiveness.

#### **Speed**

There is another critical variable to making the recruit want to accept your offer: speed\! A recruit wants to feel loved. The easiest way to accomplish that is to have a fast process from start to finish. Each day of delay sends the message, "We don't have conviction about you."

If you doubt whether this dynamic exists, recall when you raised money. Which investors were the most compelling for you? The ones that responded and decided quickly, or those that lingered in their decision process for weeks or months? Benchmark and Sequoia are famous for making investment offers within days (and sometimes hours) of meeting a company that excites them.

The offer from investors is always pending due diligence, so there is plenty of time after-the-fact for the investment firm to discover critical information about your company. In recruiting, you also can make an offer to the candidate "pending reference interviews."

Here's what a streamlined process looks like:

1. You contact a candidate and schedule a short phone interview.
2. At the phone interview, the candidate appears to be an A player.
3. Immediately schedule a second phone screen with the Hiring Manager as soon as possible. If, at this second phone interview, the candidate appears to be an A player, then ...
4. Immediately schedule a full day of onsite interviews to meet with all of the needed interviewers. This will be easy because you already follow this [Calendar Cadence](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vyxqhBB6GCCycPNvlaUyq1UcOLeCi7_nUdDIhHj1HQc/edit), so all required interviewers have scheduled to be at the office (or available remotely) on recruiting day, ready to interview. (Using this method, you can easily have several candidates for onsite interviews on the same day.) At the end of that day, the interview team convenes and makes a decision.

(Some people question whether one round of interviews is enough to make a good decision. The answer is yes because the real information comes from the Reference Interviews that follow. Google has found that more interviews do not lead to better decisions. In fact, they limit interviews to **5 total of 30 minutes each\!** They have found that the marginal benefit of more or more extended interviews is close to zero.)

1. If "yes," reach out to the candidate that evening and say: "We love you. We want you to work at our company. We want to make you an offer pending reference interviews."
2. Have a verbal discussion about what a successful offer would look like. Ask the candidate to complete this phrase: "I would join your company as long as \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_."
3. Address each request. If all are doable, move to the next stage.
4. Conduct the reference interviews. Do not skip or skimp on this stage. These interviews are the most crucial part of the interview process and give the most accurate information about how a candidate will perform.
5. If the reference interviews are wildly positive, reach back out to the candidate: "The reference interviews were great. We'd like for you to join our company. If we make you the following offer (explain every detail of the offer including benefits, etc.), would you accept?" Go back and forth until you have a verbal agreement.
6. Invite the candidate for an "offer ceremony," wherein you make them the offer, and they accept. (There is more detail on the offer process below.)

This process can take as little as two weeks from the first contact to the accepted offer. If your process becomes that fast, your acceptance rate from top candidates will start to resemble that of Benchmark and Sequoia.

Then, when your acceptance rate from top candidates begins to soar, become incredibly picky and tighten up your initial selection criteria (from the first 15-minute video call) to choose only the best of the best.

#### **Spouse**

While the candidate herself is excited about the idea of working with you, there is another person in the equation who does not get the benefit of being charmed by you and the prospects of the company: the candidate's spouse. They feel fear and have thoughts like

- "We have two kids in private school; how can we afford to reduce our current household income by 50%?"
- "Will this startup ever really pan out, or is it just another flash in the pan like all of those others?"

I find that the biggest blocker to a candidate saying "Yes" is their spouse's fear of saying "No." The antidote for someone's fear is to make them feel heard. Therefore, I always ask to talk directly to the spouse. I say to the candidate, "I know that you are excited about this company, but I imagine that your spouse is feeling fear and has many concerns. I'd like for him/her to have those concerns addressed directly and feel that he/she has a direct line of communication with me. Would you be willing to introduce me to him/her so that we can connect directly?"

The answer is usually: "Let me ask my spouse." And then, a day later, the connection is made. During the call with the spouse, I simply listen and repeat back the thoughts that I hear. If I can address them, I do. But that is not necessary. Acknowledging the thoughts is really all that is needed. The spouse usually says something like, "Thank you for doing this. In all of our years together, no boss of my spouse has ever reached out to me like this."

The candidate usually accepts shortly after that.

### **Compensation**

How much compensation do you offer new team members? How much cash and equity?

My preferred method is to:

1. Discover the market compensation for the position (role and seniority). There are plenty of online compensation studies that show this. Market compensation is whatever a big company (Microsoft, Facebook, Google) pays for this position.
2. Discover the amount of cash that the new team member would need to live comfortably (housing, food, transportation, child expenses, etc.)

It is up to the startup to match the market compensation level, not in cash as the larger companies do, but rather in a much lesser amount of cash (no less than the amount needed to live comfortably), plus equity to bridge the difference.

Here is an example to show how you calculate the equity portion. Let's say the position is a Level 3 Engineer who is paid $300,000 in total compensation at Google. The team member requires $120,000 in cash to live comfortably and invests the remainder in startup equity. Calculate the amount of equity by taking the difference between market and cash ($300,000-$120,000=$180,000) and multiplying it by four years ($180,000 x 4 \= $720,000). This amount is then divided by a factor between 1 and 2, representing a very conservative estimate of the increase in equity value over four years. A 1 represents no expected increase in Value. A 2 represents a 2x expected increase in Value. If 1.5 were used (which is the most common), the final amount would be $720,000 / 1.5 \= $480,000. So grant this amount in options; however much equity it purchases at the company's current valuation—the options vest over four years.

Then I prefer to make an offer that allows the new team member to choose how much they want to invest in the startup equity at three different levels. The lowest cash level would be the level needed to live comfortably.

Here's an example in which the company is currently worth $50mm. The company will likely need another major financing round and optional pool refresh before it reaches maturity, which is an expected 50% dilution to the current cap table. A $1 billion eventual value of the company would result in a 10x increase in the equity value. (20x increase in company value x 50% dilution \= 10x increase in equity value.)

The three options would be:

|     | Annual Cash | Equity Worth | Expected Value at $1 billion company valuation |
| :-- | :---------- | :----------- | :--------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | $120,000    | $480,000     | $4,800,000                                     |
| 2   | $140,000    | $426,666     | $4,266,666                                     |
| 3   | $160,000    | $361,333     | $3,613,333                                     |

The hope is that the new team member believes so fully in the company (and the power of the asymmetric bet) that they choose one of the two higher equity offers. This equity is thus an investment that the team member is making in the company. And with a huge advantage: They make the investment with pre-tax dollars, which doubles its purchasing power.

### **Making the Offer**

Before making an offer, it is critical to know that the candidate will accept. Once you have the offer prepared, contact the candidate and ask them to complete the following phrase:

**"I will join the company as long as …."**

They then should state all of their requirements. If you are willing to provide each of these, you will have a successful hire. If there is one that you cannot provide, discuss it with the candidate to see if there is some alternative that you both can accept.

Once this process is complete, then ask the candidate:

**"If we were to make you the following offer (state the offer in full detail, including cash, equity, benefits, etc.), would you accept?"**

If they say yes, then make them an offer. If you skip this step and simply make them the offer, it is very common for them to ask for a few more things after-the-fact (signing bonus, moving expenses, etc.). You will then be in the awkward position of either giving these (and thereby allowing a political culture to begin) or starting the relationship on a negative note by saying no. It is far better to get the candidate to pre-agree in complete detail before making the offer. Then the relationship begins with a resoundingly positive "Yes\! Thank you\! I'm so excited\!"

The granting and accepting of a job offer is a very emotional moment for a person. Making a big deal out of it is a good thing. We recommend that you make a ceremony out of it. Invite the candidate to receive the offer in person. Create a ritual out of this process. Here are some possibilities:

- Hand the written offer to the candidate with two hands and a ceremonial bow.
- Give company schwag.
- Give hugs and high-fives.

Whatever you do, make it fun and memorable.

### **Onboarding**

Most companies spend extraordinary resources of time, money, and equity to bring on a new team member, and then almost entirely drop the ball on quickly getting that team member onboarded and up to speed on how the company works so that they can begin making a full contribution. Don't make this mistake\! Give onboarding even more attention, time, and energy than you give to recruiting. After all, many of the people you are spending time with during recruiting will not become team members. Whereas 100% of the people that you spend time with during onboarding are already team members. Focus your energy there\!

Write a checklist of all of the information that a team member would need to be fully effective. Write all of this information down and make a video of it. Share this checklist, the written/video info, and the 90-day roadmap with each new team member as early as you can, even before they start.

On their first day at the office, have them come in two hours after the normal start of the day so that there are plenty of people there to greet the new team member. Assign each new team member a buddy with whom they'll check in each day for fifteen minutes for the first two weeks. These fifteen minutes are for the new team member to ask questions that arise and for the buddy to ensure that the new team member is going through the checklist.

Todd McKinnon of Okta takes it a step further, which I recommend that you do as well: "My best tip when onboarding a new direct report. Meet with them for 1 hour daily for the first month. Simple but effective."
