[Teaching / Training](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sGF4V0xFWjESabSZElwF3YienjtiLZtp81YTHe-zMpM/edit) (1 min)

To perform a job well, a person needs to have:

- the skills to do so
- the organization to follow through
- the behaviors that match the company's values

You can teach all of these.

Therefore, failure to perform is most often a failure of training or hiring.

The best way that I know of to teach (or train) is:

- You watch me perform the role several times. You document the process that you see me going through. Feel free to ask questions. Once I think that you understand what I am doing …

- I watch you perform the role. I will give you regular feedback. Once I see that you are performing the role well …

- You train your backup to do it. This training is what actually solidifies the learning for you, as it forces you to understand what you are doing to explain it to another.

If you are training a manager or new hire, this looks like:

- You watch me run all of the 1-1s and team meetings for 2-4 weeks.
- You write down my process for running the 1-1s and team meetings.
- I watch you run the 1-1s and team meetings for 2-4 weeks and give you feedback.
- You invite your \#2 to watch you run the 1-1s and team meetings for 2-4 weeks.
- You watch your \#2 run the 1-1s and team meeting for 2-4 weeks.
