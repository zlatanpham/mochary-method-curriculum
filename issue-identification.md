[Issue Identification](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yfnZqztmnHatFavMqMJ40_tAN7YUcfnQgo4HrcU7SBQ/edit) (1 min)

There are two excellent prompts that I know of to encourage people to identify the company's key issues that need to be solved.

- "If you were CEO, what are the most important issues (maximum 3\) that you would solve in the next 90 days, and how?"

- "When you source the emotions of Anger or Fear and think about the company, what are your thoughts?"

Using these as a starting point, ask each team member to list the major issues they see facing the company today.

List them in the following format:

- Issue:

  - _A detailed description of what the problem or challenge is._

- What I did to help create this situation:

  - _If you make an honest effort to declare how you contributed to creating the situation, then others will not feel blamed, and you will likely see a way that you can unwind the problem without relying on others to do so._

- Proposed Solution:

  - _If you have done a good job of declaring how you helped create the situation, you can likely reverse those steps. Either way, please write out a solution with actions, a [DRI: Directly-Responsible Individual](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1I4jBy1XryEdknFoDCMUY93PEn0rR-oOOx6yiLSiaa38/edit) for each, and a due date._

  - _You may think, "I don't know the answer. I'd rather list the options." Please don't. Please write out what you would do if you had to decide, and you couldn't ask anyone for guidance. This declarative statement will be much easier for the rest of us to react to._
