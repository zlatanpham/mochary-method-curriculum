### [Politics](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cINzNPcmFPrK8wLQ6L693UDRaioVsZxdaK5XPNkIMew/edit) (2 min)

In this context, "politics" means lobbying to gain personal benefit. Politics are poison for a company. They direct energy away from customer problem-solving, and once they take hold, the result is a quick race to the bottom.

Politics are created when someone successfully lobbies the CEO or their manager for some benefit. Others see this, so they, in turn, lobby. They then gain a benefit, and the virus spreads quickly throughout the organization.

It often begins very innocently: "Excuse me, can I please talk to you about a raise? I have been at this company for a year now and have shown utter dedication by doing such-and-such, and I believe that I now deserve a raise…"

This sounds compelling, and you, of course, want to reward dedication. But if you give a raise based on this conversation, the whole company will learn that the way to get a raise is simply to ask you for it.

Suddenly everyone will be trying to curry your favor. Be very careful here. You may enjoy this behavior, but it is toxic for the company.

The only way to prevent politics is never to allow lobbying to be successful. The only way to do this is to have a written policy about as many situations as possible, particularly around compensation and titles (raises and promotions). Apply this policy to all team members, all the time.

It isn't easy to create objective criteria for raises and promotions, but there are models. The most successful method I know of is called [Grade Level Planning](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AeS9TDfedHUGnsY2JRNCJtNsZJRCDGUssmYgz3-JLD8/edit#gid=380521419)—at least, that's what Tesla calls it. It calls for a very detailed definition of every position in the company, and every seniority level, along with specific compensation metrics for each position and level. This is then shared throughout the company. Team members can then clearly see what they need to do to receive the next compensation and title level. Managers must not deviate from this written schema.

When a company is smaller (fewer than fifty employees or so) and growing fast, there is often so much fluidity that it can be challenging to implement Grade Level Planning (GLP). Most companies end up doing GLP at 150+ employees, but that is often too late. The compromise is somewhere in the middle. I recommend starting to think about GLP at twenty-five to fifty employees and then implementing as soon as is practical after that.
