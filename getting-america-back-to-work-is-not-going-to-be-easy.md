I just got off the phone with a CEO of a manufacturing company with plants in Michigan and Ohio. They make outdoor storage and playsets.

They are one of the lucky companies, as demand for their products has soared in this time of "nest-in-place." People are spending all of their time at home (rather than traveling for vacations) and therefore want play structures for their kids and home improvement projects (storage sheds) for themselves.

But the company can't fulfill the orders. Why? Last month, their supply of materials (primarily produced in China) was interrupted as that country shut down. That issue has largely gone away as China has reopened.

Now the issue is … many of the company's employees won't come to work. In their Ohio plant, one person contracted COVID, and ever since, 40% of the team have not come back to work.

The Michigan plant has been shut down for several weeks and has just received authorization to reopen (hospitals are using storage sheds for PPE and are therefore deemed an essential product). In preparation for this reopening, the company is instituting all the policies it can think of to minimize the threat of COVID (monthly testing of all employees at the cost of about $150/test, physical distancing, frequent deep cleanings, masks for all, etc.).

The company's factory-floor workers are relatively low-wage earners who have neither savings nor other options for work. Many are likely receiving unemployment. But many are probably feeling real financial distress.

The company called its entire workforce to let them know of the reopening, expecting they would be eager to come back to work. That was not the case. Only ⅓ of the workers said they would be coming back. The others are afraid of contracting COVID. Their fear is real.

Getting America back to work will not be easy.
