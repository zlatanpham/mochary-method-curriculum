[Coach \- how to find one](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1P3xgXHzXqjoytTDRyZbXcWc8GKDGhCHfRIHiN9lVGkA/edit) (1 min)

When I was younger, I was a high-level windsurfer and would travel for weeks at a time to Maui to practice my hobby. The harness put a lot of pressure on my back, and I would at some point invariably pinch a nerve causing my back to seize up. I then would go to a chiropractor who would adjust me, and instantly I would be pain-free. The chiropractor would then tell me that I needed ten more weekly sessions. Since I was often only traveling to Maui for several weeks, I could rarely complete any of these follow-up sessions.

Then I moved to San Francisco. I started windsurfing in the Bay and, sure enough, tweaked my back again. I once again found a chiropractor who successfully adjusted my back. But when we finished the session, she did not say that I needed any follow-up visits. I was confused. I asked her about it. She responded: "Other chiropractors need the money. I don't. I am independently wealthy. I do this because I love fixing people. And you are fixed."

From that moment on, I only ever wanted to work with people who do what they do for love, not money. They're hard to find. But they exist.

I have noticed that there is one thing common among them: They rarely seek work. Meaning, they focus their time on practicing their craft, not interviewing for jobs.

If you are looking for a coach, you can take one of two approaches:

- Get several names of potential coaches, and invite them in to interview. Most will be willing to, and from that pool, you will be able to choose. Know, though, that the best of the best likely won’t be willing to participate in such a process. Or,

- Spend the same amount of time you would spend interviewing, and instead spend it:

  - Finding who is considered to be the best coach.

  - Trying to convince that person to coach you. These nuggets will help:

    - Coaches are essentially teachers, so they love people eager to learn, experiment, and do. Show that you are an enthusiastic student by reading their materials in advance.

    - See [Fundraising- The Relationship Method](https://docs.google.com/document/d/163t4I3CzQ-CUScBYp6fCxpboSgHxCB7syd4Jtzw7nco/edit?usp=drive_web&ouid=102503928790226855337) and [Selling](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1T6fnyDDqdzAFdzJzZkiAnaKvZzjzkX5HSwAjuedvlQQ/edit). The principles work on coaches as well.

Both will take a similar amount of time. I believe that \#2 yields a far better result.
