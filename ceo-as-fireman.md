[CEO as fireman](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ndhJME8Nx5yWa9tqhEMRwi5pgibYy6AzB46zhvSeFEg/edit) (1 min)

A fireman lives in the firehouse, ready to respond to a fire whenever it comes. Most of the time, there is no fire to respond to, so the fireman waits. The most enterprising ones use that downtime to do something productive.

The best CEOs that I coach do the same. They manage the executive team, but they do not do any single department function. They have large swaths of open time in their calendar. They keep that space available to put out fires that might occur. When no fires arise, they use the large open swaths of time to:

- Write the next iteration of the company and product vision.
- Build relationships with key stakeholders (employees, partners, customers, investors) by reaching out to them to know that the CEO is thinking about them.

These are the functions that only the CEO can do. If she doesn't make time for them, they don't happen, and the company suffers.

_Next, Executive as fireman …_

_When all the systems are green, you sit and watch._

_When one of the systems turns yellow or red, you can step in and operate it yourself (and model for those who will continue to do it after you)._
