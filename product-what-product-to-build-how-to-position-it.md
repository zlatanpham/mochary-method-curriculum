[Product: What product to build? How to position it?](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DlphokiVnRnsRDKA_d48QIpmy5VBBfn4760wS8WfQ1Q/edit) (3 min)

I often hear the following line: "We have built a new product and are ready to launch it, but we haven't yet figured out how to position it to customers in a way that resonates with them."

When I hear this, I know that the Product Development process has gone far off the rails.

Here is what the Product Development process should be:

1. Talk to lots and lots and lots of people who are potential customers. Ask them, "What are your core problems and frustrations related to … (the area that you are focused on)?"

2. Repeat back to each potential customer what you heard them say, by stating "I think I heard you say …."

   1. Then ask, "Is that right?"

3. Keep repeating back until they say "Yes."

4. Write down every customer type and problem. Start to see the trends. Put them in buckets. Example

   1. Customers with over 1,000 employees have this pain.
   2. Customers in FL have this pain.
   3. The Marketing departments have this pain.

5. For each bucket (also called segment), ask.

   1. How many such customers are there?
   2. How much money do they have to spend on a solution?
   3. How good are the current alternative solutions?

6. Pick your beachhead. It should be the segment that has

   1. The most customers, with
   2. The most money to spend on a solution, and
   3. The worst alternative current solutions
   4. The easiest for you implement

7. Now build a product that solves that segment's problem.

If you do this, the Positioning process is easy. It is simply …

1. State the problem that the customer has. Then … "If you have this problem, we have your solution."

That is it.

If you have built a product, and don't yet know exactly which individual decision-makers have the problem that this product solves, then you have done things in reverse order.

Start over. Go talk to lots and lots and lots of people who are potential customers. Ask them, "What are your core problems and frustrations related to … (the area that you are focused on)?"

They will then give you your positioning.

If you are a customer, be careful. You are just one customer. It would be best if you talked to a range of customers to discover common pain points. If you build for just one customer (even if it's you), you are likely building a customized solution, not a product.

When you have a product with users, and you are continually talking to them about their ongoing problems, one question that quickly arises is: "Which users' problems should I solve?"

[Rahul Vohra of Superhuman has come up with a very useful framework to answer this question](https://review.firstround.com/how-superhuman-built-an-engine-to-find-product-market-fit). The ones that truly love your product and would feel great sadness if they no longer had access to it. They are your power users and evangelists. Double down on them, and those like them\!

By the way, this customer problem discovery process is so powerful that it works even when a company already has a scaled product. One of my portfolio companies sells a product to hospitals. And they are winning. They are already a unicorn and growing quickly. But the CEO could see that hospitals are not great customers because they don't have much cash, and they make decisions by committee (i.e., very slowly and painfully).

I asked him what customers he'd like to have. He said: "Pharma and medical device companies. They have tons of cash and are streamlined." I said: "Great, then go talk to them and find out what their problems are. See if you can solve them."

He did. He spent three months doing so. He discovered their primary problem and realized that he could easily build a solution to this problem by tapping into his current solution. He described the solution to pharma and device CEOs and they love it.

He has already collected several million dollars in advance payments to develop the solution (which will be easy to develop). Once created, the current contracts will turn into hundreds of millions of dollars in contracts, with much more TAM behind that.

Six months ago, he thought he'd never get past $2-3b in value. Now he's confident he'll get to $100b.

**Lesson:** Never stop doing this customer problem discovery process. Both with your current customers and the customers you wish you had.
