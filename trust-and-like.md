[Video of Andy Bromberg (CEO of Eco) explaining how to build impactful relationships (10 min)](https://youtu.be/Olze6vMqfso)

Think about the people you like. Do you like people who talk about themselves and show no interest or curiosity about you and your life? Or do you like people who ask about you, listen attentively, and are genuinely curious about what makes you tick?

If you want to create a meaningful relationship with someone:

1. Get genuinely curious about their lives, both at work and home.
2. Ask them lots of questions.
3. Prove to them you're listening by saying, "I think I heard you say…" and then repeating back to them the highlights of what they said to you.
4. When the meeting ends, write down as much information about the person as you remember.

At your next meeting with them, say, "The last time we talked, you said…" and again repeat the highlights. They will find it heartwarming to see someone who cares enough about the details of their life to remember them.

Also, let them know what they have done that you appreciate. If nothing else, you can always enjoy that they took the time to meet.

Be explicit about your intent to build a relationship. Say something like, "I would like to develop a real relationship with you." That intent alone is heartwarming. And will make the person want to invest the time to create that relationship with you.

After the first meeting, ask for a second. Since the stated purpose is to build a relationship, the person is likely to say yes. If you have genuinely allowed them to speak about themselves, they will have enjoyed the meeting and look forward to another.

These meetings do not need to be extensive, nor do they need to be in person. A fifteen-minute phone call can be as effective as a one-hour meal if, after time has passed, you demonstrate genuine care and a memory for the details of their life. After two meetings like this, they will trust and like you when you listen to them and reflect on what they say. Several more, and they will love you. You'll know when the moment comes that they like and trust you. They will likely say it. If not, their body language will show it.

If you aren't good at reading body language, wait. At some point, the person will say something like (and this is an actual quote from an investor): "I really like you. I want to work with you. Now tell me what your company does."

To summarize, the four keys are:

1. Ask them about their lives.
2. Prove that you heard them by saying, "I think I heard you say ...:"
3. Prove that you remember by saying at the next meeting, "The last time we talked, you said …."
4. Let them know what you appreciate about them.

If you do all four of these things, you will have created a bond, and you then have a willing partner (i.e., investor, customer, recruit) in whatever your endeavor is.

When most CEOs hear of this method for the first time, they have a substantial adverse reaction. This method feels unnatural and goes against their instincts to close quickly. Later, once they have tried the technique, and it works like a charm, they become raving fans. Therefore, my best advice is to try it on a few prospective partners and see if it is more effective than the traditional approach.

### Strengthening the Relationship

Once you have met with someone a couple of times and demonstrated your memory and care for their lives, you have created a relationship. This connection is likely enough for them to like you. But why settle for just enough? To further strengthen the relationship, continue to be curious about them, and show them that you remember what they say. Three to five rounds of contact will solidify the relationship. Not every one of these rounds needs to be an in-person meeting—it can be enough to send a quick message, as when someone sent me this email:

_Matt,_

_Your old house, no??_

_Peter_

I felt honored that he remembered where I used to live. And I now feel even more connected to him.

Lest you think this is a tactic that only over-aggressive young CEOs use, know that the person who sent this message is a very wealthy retired CEO/founder who wants nothing. He was just genuinely reminded about me.

Below is another example, a message of appreciation from Bill Trenchard of First Round Capital.

_Hey Matt,_

_Just wanted to drop a note of thanks. I really enjoyed our talk on Tuesday and brief ones since. Also greatly appreciate you treating me to lunch. Talk soon\!_

_Bill_

I feel honored that he took the time to appreciate me.

The following comes from Andy Bromberg, founding CEO of CoinList, who takes it a step further:

_At the risk of giving up my secrets, I'd suggest handwritten thank you notes. The response I get to my handwritten notes is incredible. People are floored. And often remember me as "the handwritten note guy."_

So make it a practice to regularly go through your contact list and send out messages of appreciation. (Chris Fralic of First Round Capital, in his [iconic blogpost](http://firstround.com/review/how-to-become-insanely-well-connected/), states that he does this every Friday for one hour. Andy Bromberg does it for a few minutes each day.) You will be shocked by the massive goodwill that it generates.

The messages you send need not be complicated. Here are [3 simple ideas from the internet](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/21AJMTJzdyA).

Please know that the above techniques, and all of those I have written about in relationship-building below, are manipulative. You can use them for good (to create a connection with someone you will treat well) or for bad (to connect with someone you will not treat well). I hope that you will use them for good only.
