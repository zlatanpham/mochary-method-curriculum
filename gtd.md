## [Getting Things Done (GTD)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rSfwOrlTa8kcRoHIikOBVgrZRZPxq3Sm5F7Hb21TmvQ/edit) (5 min to read, 1 day to implement)

Everyone needs an organizational system to track goals, priorities, and tasks. Most successful CEOs that I know use the approach outlined in the book [_Getting Things Done: The art of stress-free productivity_ by David Allen](https://www.amazon.com/Getting-Things-Done-Stress-Free-Productivity/dp/0143126563/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIxdPP4fT56gIVXB6tBh1sugzcEAAYASAAEgJ1vfD_BwE&hvadid=323368203351&hvdev=c&hvlocphy=9031905&hvnetw=g&hvqmt=b&hvrand=7585231154038880700&hvtargid=kwd-305149641073&hydadcr=21908_10171249&keywords=getting+things+done+workbook&qid=1596281711&sr=8-2&tag=googhydr-20). While the book is dense, it is worth reading in its entirety. The essence of Allen's system is:

Each day, process every item in your Inbox (defined broadly as all Inboxes \[email, text, Slack, Jira, etc.\] and all to-do's). **If the action takes \<2 minutes to complete, do it immediately.** If not, then write down what the necessary action is, and place it one of the following lists:

1\. **Next Actions:** These are the next tasks on your priority list separated into areas of context.

- Computer (tasks where you need access to your computer)
- Calls (you can complete these when you don't have access to a computer, e.g., riding in a car)
- Outside (tasks that can only be achieved outside, such as errands)
- Home (functions that you can only complete at home).

You should write tasks as single actions (as opposed to broad goals). The key is not to think about what needs to be done once you write down the Next Action. You should write The Next Action so clearly that all you need to do is follow its direction when you read it next.

Computer

- Write the first draft of 10-year Company Vision and 3-month Roadmap
- Write the first draft of Sales Playbook

  Calls

- John 650-555-3452 schedule company offsite
- Mary 415-555-1234 review draft financing docs, paragraph by paragraph

  Outside

- Walgreens \- pick up the prescription

  Home

- Clean out garage

2\. **Waiting For**: This is the list of things you have asked others to do and are waiting for. List the person to whom you have delegated, the requested action, and the date you made the request. You can then quickly scan your Waiting For List and see which aging requests are still outstanding. Move these aging requests to your Next Action list and ask the person again for the item.

Waiting For

Sarah- feedback on Sales Playbook, 3-18

Jim \- Write-up issue for next Leadership Team Meeting, 3-19

Bill- time to meet, 3-19

3\. **Someday/Maybe:** This is the list of things that you one day want to do but don't need to get done now (e.g., read a book).

Someday/Maybe

Schedule a guitar lesson

Order the book Getting Things Done by David Allen

4\. **Agenda:** This is your list of regular meetings. When you think of something that you want to discuss with someone with whom you meet regularly, don't simply reach out to them via text or email with the issue. Instead, write it down on your Agenda list. Then, when you meet with that person, check your Agenda list and review everything accumulated there.

Spouse

Leadership Team

Are we having enough fun?

10-year Company Vision

3-month Company Roadmap

Inefficient leaders waste a lot of time reaching out about or responding to one-off issues in real-time. A much more efficient method is to batch your issues and discuss them all at once. This method does not apply to urgent matters. You need to address those immediately. But by addressing many issues regularly, soon critical issues will disappear.

5\. **Projects:** This list is for projects with more than one Next Action that you can only do one after the other. Write out all of the Next Actions required to get to completion. Add the first one to your Next Action list. When you complete it, cut-and-paste the second action to the Next Action list.

6\. **Review:** This is your pace for reviewing the lists above.

Daily: Next Action and Waiting For

Weekly: Someday/Maybe, Agenda and Projects

And finally, use your calendar to schedule the Next Actions that need to happen on a specific day or at a particular time. I recommend that you put your reviews (\#6 above) in your calendar.
