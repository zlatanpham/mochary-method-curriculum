[How to maintain personal connection in a remote world](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15bF88nIzZGJT9NTDXK6IR1ZzRCBqYMr8NK_No8nM0aI/edit) (3 min)

As CEO, it is critical to have a personal connection with your team. They need to know that you care about them before they care about the work they do for you.

When in the office, this personal connection is relatively easy to maintain. You say hello to them each morning and goodbye to them each evening when you leave. You see them at lunchtime and ask them about their lives.

But how do you maintain that connection when there are no informal in-person interactions that serve as prompts to say these "hellos," "goodbyes," and "what is going on in your life"?

Create your own prompts.

First, get to know some personal information about each person on your team (the name of their spouse, their children, their pets, where they grew up, what they like to do for fun). You can create a [Personal Info, Team \- example](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Ti_xaV9IVvj-bklxOjNY-IeGsC-YqcgvB03qvfFQrnI/edit#gid=0) (1 min) and ask people to enter their information there.

Then, schedule some time each week (I recommend one hour per week) to reach out to various members of your community (work team, investors, family, friends) and let them know that you are thinking of them. The message need not be long. The only intent is to let them know that you are thinking about them.

Here are some examples:

"Thinking of you. Hope you, Dan, Cindy, and Luke are doing well."

"I saw this article on tennis and thought of you."

That's it. The message need not be long nor elaborate. The only purpose is to let your colleague know that you are thinking about them and remember the important things about their life.

It takes very little time, and it is massively effective.

You are likely thinking: "Matt, this is such an obvious ploy. My people will see right through it."

If so, to you, I reply: "Many of my coachees still send me messages like this. I know exactly what they are doing. Hell, I'm the one who showed them how to do it. And yet, I appreciate it every time. Because I know that they intend to create a connection with me and that always feels good."

Another anecdote: The best operating CEO I've ever known, who self-admittedly doesn't have much emotional intelligence at all, once asked me: "Matt, please help me to be more empathetic and create an emotional connection with my team." So, I gave him the advice above. Being the best operator, he immediately and faithfully followed the advice.

A month later, I facilitated a 2-day offsite for him and his executive team. When, at one point, he left the room, the entire executive team turned to me, and said "How did you do it? He used to be a robot. And then about 30 days ago, he suddenly turned into this super-caring, super-compassionate guy." And they started sharing with me examples of ways that he reached out to them in a very personal way. "I was on the airplane with my family getting ready to go to my parents' house for Thanksgiving when I got a text from him saying: 'I hope you, Dan, Cindy, and Luke have a great time with your parents in Michigan. Safe travels.' I was blown away."

Listening to all this was the newest executive hire, who had only just come on board. She was shocked. "You mean he wasn't like this two months ago? I just went through the recruiting process with him and concluded that he is the most empathetic CEO I have ever known or even heard of."
