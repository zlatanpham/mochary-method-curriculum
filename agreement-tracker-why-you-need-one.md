[How to use Asana as an Agreement Tracker: Easy, Medium, Expert levels](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLiksA_rhPy74zJQ9VcSnI7XDMZIinyifG) (by Regina Gerbeaux, CoS to Matt Mochary)

When you are in a small group (less than 20 people in one office space), you don't need a system of sharing information because everyone in the group can literally hear each other. All team members can grok the CEO's priorities. And the CEO groks the obstacles that the teammates are encountering.

But once you can no longer physically hear each other talk (i.e., when you are working remotely even if less than 20 people, or you are in person but more than 20 people), then there is no way to overhear those priorities and obstacles. Now you need to create a structured system of information flow. If you do not, team members will not work on the highest priority tasks, and the CEO will not unblock the team members. The system must be written (otherwise, the details cannot be shared with those that happened not to be present for the physical conversation), and agreements (i.e., actions that I have agreed to do) must be tracked to completion.

People sometimes use a Google Doc or Sheet to track agreements for a particular meeting (a 1-1 or team meeting). This step has limited value because these Docs then proliferate, and each team member has tasks listed across many docs, which is impractical for them to track.

For an agreement-tracker to be effective, each person must have only one location where they need to look to see all the actions they have agreed to do. This is precisely why action-trackers like Monday.com and Asana were created. They have overhead (i.e., it takes more time to write down an action in Asana than it does to write it on an individual notepad), so it should only be used for actions where you have agreed with someone else (i.e., your manager, your teammates, etc.) that you will do that action.

I recommend using a lower overhead tool like an individual electronic notepad for actions only on your own to-do list.

When implementing an agreement-tracker in your company, there are a few best practices to follow:

- Start using it yourself first so that you are familiar with it.
- Then start using it in your 1-1s with your direct reports. It will be more overhead than using a Google Doc, but this is simply a stepping stone to the next step. Let it sit here for a few meetings until each report is using the tool correctly.
- Then start using it in your team meeting. Let it sit here for a few meetings until all see the value of it.
  - This action is where it will become powerful. Now each team member will see just how much each other team member is getting done.
    - This transparency will instantly boost morale. Because up until now, each member doubted that any other member was actually doing any work at all. Each person thought they were the only one doing actual work and questioned whether they should continue to be the chump. (i.e., morale was falling)
- Then require your directs to start using it with their 1-1s, and eventually in their team meetings.
- Continue to require that the tool get cascaded down until everyone in the company is using it.

There is one exception to this usage. Engineering departments often prefer to use a more technical action-tracker like Jira. (Although I know plenty of engineering departments that use Asana and love it.) If your engineering department prefers Jira, that is fine. Allow them to use it and not be on the rest-of-the-company system.

When I came into a company and was the 1-day-a-week CEO to implement my management system, I always implemented this action-tracking tool (usually Asana). I did it at Clearbit, Angellist, Bolt, etc. It worked magically.

Then I started coaching bigger companies. When I suggested this tool, I got push-back (usually from the older VPs on the executive team, who I think didn't want to learn a new tool). Their excuse was always similar: "Matt, those companies you mentioned are all less than 150 people. But we're over 1,000 people. There is no way that we could impose a universal tool here."

I am not interested in forcing people, so I didn't.

Until I started coaching Francis Davidson at Sonder … with 1300 employees … all on Asana. And the company operated better than any of the others that I coached with more than a few hundred employees. I finally had the example that I needed\!

So, now that you are working remotely, and even when you return in person one day, use an action-tracking tool throughout the entire company. Agreed-upon actions will actually get done, everyone will be able to see that clearly, and morale will soar … creating an upward spiral of productivity.

Note on Asana:

If you choose to use Asana, there are several rules that you need to follow to achieve success:

- Train people on how to use it before you ask them to use it for work. This training needs to be nothing more than a 15-minute session.
  - Identify the most Asana-knowledgeable person in the company.
  - Ask that person to write a list of all the useful Asana actions.
  - Schedule a team training session
    - The trainer shows how to perform the first action on a screen visible to all.
    - All participants perform that same action on their screen.
    - If any participant gets stuck, they can ask their neighbor or the trainer for help.
    - Repeat for all the actions on the list.
- Suggest that people put individual tasks (i.e., those they do not have to agree with someone else) in an individual task-manager (like Evernote, Omnifocus, Things3, etc.), not Asana. Once Asana gets populated with too many tasks, recognizing the actual priority actions becomes overwhelming and difficult. Only if someone becomes very comfortable with Asana should they attempt to use it as their sole task manager.
- Never blindly assign someone a task in Asana. Only use Asana to log agreements already made (i.e., the person agreed to do the action). An easy way to ensure this: Only the action-doer is the person who writes the task in Asana. They will never write something that they didn't agree to.

There are many tools that can effectively be used as agreement trackers. ClickUp, Monday.com, Asana, Height, Coda, Notion. Each have their pros and cons. I recommend that you test each before choosing one.
