Mistakes happen. We all make them. But how do we make things right once we realize that we've made a mistake?

Three steps. Repair, Rewind, Redo.

1. Repair

   1. The first thing to do is acknowledge:
      1. what I did
      2. the damage that it caused
      3. that I did not intend to cause that damage
      4. make a commitment that I will not do that action again.
         1. "From now on in that situation, I will …"

2. Rewind

   1. "Now, I'd like to go back in time and do it the way I plan on doing it from now on.”

3. Redo
   1. Redo the statement or the action in the new way.

---

This process allows others to see that you recognize the damage you did, that you did not intend to cause that damage, and that you are able and willing to do it in a non-damaging way.
