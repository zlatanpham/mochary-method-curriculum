[Do Remote Right](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BY8fjKuF-NSQdMcw9SDwnYM1ZJLSW1bW7SNSzOHd-wU/edit) _(work in progress)_

About the authors

Sid Sijbrandij is the founder and CEO of Gitlab, the largest "intentionally remote" company in the world by team members: over 1500 as of October 2021\. Sid has spent many years perfecting the art of running an all-remote company and would like to share his learnings with the world.

Matt Mochary is the coach to many of the tech world's top CEOs (eBay, Reddit, Coinbase, Brex) and investors (Sequoia, Benchmark), including several intentionally remote companies (Gitlab, Mattermost). He has directly seen the benefits of all remote and believes that "remote done right" beats a hybrid, and likely an all-in-person, structure every time.

This book, therefore, is about how to do remote right, at least in the minds of Sid and Matt.

Here is how Sid defines the [stages of remote](https://twitter.com/sytses/status/1278370958999339008).

Introduction

In March 2020, the emerging pandemic forced the entire world to go all remote with no warning or time to prepare. Despite the utter lack of planning, most companies discovered that productivity didn't suffer. In many cases, it increased.

But there were cracks. Parents of young children felt the stress of not having a quiet space to take work video calls. Those who lived alone felt the mental pain of being isolated for weeks and months on end. Teams started to lose emotional connection, and group meetings sometimes became cantankerous and dysfunctional because of it. Zoom fatigue became a real thing. Some people were having less fun.

Many people began to long for a return to the office, believing it would eliminate these new stresses. You may be one of these people.

While you, or any of your team members, may long to get back to the office, an all-in-person structure is likely no longer a viable option for you— many of your team members like being remote and want to stay that way. If you want to keep them, you'll have to accommodate this desire. If you don't, they will leave for a remote company. And if you allow for both remote and office, then you'll have a hybrid structure.

And this is where the danger begins. Here is [why hybrid doesn't work](https://twitter.com/sytses/status/1264341436138270720). Sid and Matt believe that there will be a trough of sorrow that companies will go through when they try to implement hybrid remote. Here is why:

- **Twitter, Square, Facebook, and Shopify** allow employees to work remotely, but that doesn't mean that those companies are closing their HQ or offices.

  - "Many companies are learning that their workers are just as, or even more productive, working from home," all-remote is more effective even though it is happening suddenly, without proper organization, and during a pandemic that itself is stressful and lowering productivity, especially for people that have children that can't go to school."
  - Somehow the lesson that companies deduce from this isn't that they should go all remote, but that they should go hybrid, combining remote and co-located work. I think that hybrid is much more challenging and less likely to be successful. This thread will include examples of why it is hard.
  - These companies are going hybrid for the wrong reasons. According to Mark Zuckerberg, "Social bond building, culture, creativity, white-boarding, and brainstorming" needs to happen at the office.

- **Communication and Connection.** When remote, it is vital to be intentional about informal communication (see the link). But that doesn't mean that having part of the people in the office will help make the remote people feel included; instead, it will make it harder to include them.
  - [Tactics for creating and maintaining human connection remotely](https://twitter.com/sytses/status/1250946875143815168)
    - Speedy meetings of 25 minutes instead of 30 give you time to recover between calls and allow people to join before meetings start for some banter.
    - Lead with empathy: each work-related call should begin with an earnest, genuine "How are you?" or a similar and appropriate introduction. It's important to remember that everyone is facing a battle that you know nothing about, and in a remote setting, you should actively listen.
    - Welcome interruptions in calls: when pets, children, or partners interrupt a call, this is an opportunity to bond. Take a few minutes to talk to the person if they are open to it or ask the team member about their pet.
    - Using emojis to convey emotion: The results show that proper use of emoticons, emoji, and stickers, especially positive emotions, is conducive to relationship formation and cognitive understanding. They help participants express emotions and manage interrelations.
    - Talent shows: they are relatively easy to organize. Simply add a calendar invite two weeks in advance, affix a Google Doc agenda to the invite for team members to sign up to showcase a talent, arrange a panel of 3-5 judges, and have a list of prizes ready to go.
    - Coffee chats: have a name for 25-minute calls between two people without an agenda. This time empowers people to have these important conversations. There is no agenda, and you can talk about work or not. Make doing them part of onboarding and use[@donut](https://twitter.com/Donut) to have them happen regularly.
    - Mixer calls aim to help team members meet more folks from other groups or functions they might not otherwise get to spend a lot of time working or interacting with. Two team members set up a single Zoom line, and each of those team members invites someone else to join.
    - Juice Box Chats are a chance for GitLab team members and their children, grandchildren, or other members of their family to get to know one another as well. These chats can be informal or focus on a specific topic; Legos, SuperHeroes, camping, and video games are all great.
    - Team Social Calls are informal social calls regularly scheduled to build camaraderie. The data team has them every Tuesday. Team members and managers are encouraged to create these calls as a medium for informal, agenda-free interaction between team members.
    - AMA (Ask Me Anything) sessions serve as an opportunity to ask funny and far-fetched questions that enable a more personal connection. It's particularly important to consider ongoing AMAs with executives. AMAs humanize leaders and remind teams that we are all more alike than unlike.
    - Celebrations are essential—for example, the kickoff of a new (fiscal) year or a significant revenue milestone. We've had calls with over 400 team members. Get a great MC to pump up the enthusiasm as[@emilieschario](https://twitter.com/emilieschario) does for us.
    - Holiday parties will be virtual during the pandemic. Think about ways to dress up for the occasion—for example, an ugly sweater competition.
    - Global pizza parties are where teams arrange shared meals around the world. Global pizza parties, for example, are possible to document and enjoy in a shared setting (Zoom or Slack), though one may wish to consider a breakfast pizza depending on the time zone.
    - Coworking calls are scheduled working sessions on Zoom where team members can work through challenging tasks with a coworker or simply hang out while each person works on their tasks. Want to try advanced mode? Screen share as you work together.
- **Collaboration.** And stop saying that all creative thinking needs a whiteboard. There are two advantages to a whiteboard (you can draw arrows and circles) but linked are [17 reasons why a shared Google Doc is better](https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/collaboration-and-whiteboarding/#google-docs-as-a-remote-whiteboard), including that everyone can write on it simultaneously.
- **Who is allowed to be remote?**
  - At Facebook, employees will have to be at a certain seniority level to work remotely. In our experience, junior people tend to have more experience working digitally, not less.
- **The same experience in a meeting? Or…Horrible Hybrid Calls\!**
  - With hybrid, it is hard to give everyone the same work experience. Shopify did a great job thinking through this and will require everyone in a meeting to be physically separate and have their camera and audio setup.
  - If you don't require this, you get hybrid calls, which are horrible ([see link](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/communication/#hybrid-calls-are-horrible)). The only thing worse isn't getting invited to the meeting in the first place because the co-located people had an impromptu chat and even forgot to tell you the outcome.
  - I think that whenever there is a headquarter, there will always be two ways of communicating. To get everyone on the same level, you need the leadership to leave the shared office so that the only headquarter is the one online.
- **Remote does not have to mean Work From Home.**
  - During COVID, we tend to equate working remotely with Working From Home (WFH). At GitLab, we'll pay for office space if you want it. WFH will never be the best for everyone. We see some people who prefer an office in the beginning transition to WFH during their first months.
- **Productive remote people will leave Hybrid for All Remote**.
  - My prediction is that the leadership will keep working from the headquarters at most hybrid companies, and the default way of working will degrade from 'remote first' to 'remote allowed' (remote employees a second class citizens).
  - Employees will discover that the company didn't shift from rewarding attendance to rewarding output and that remote workers are not getting promoted at an equal rate because they are less visible.
  - The productive remote employees will leave for 'all remote' companies that invested in getting everyone a manager who understands what they do by having only one function reporting to a manager, not a multifunctional team of which the manager doesn't understand most disciplines.
  - After their most productive remote people leave, the hybrid companies will blame the lack of productivity on remote instead of the actual cause of hybrid being very hard. You'll see the Yahoo/IBM-like moves to force everyone to come to the office again.
  - Andreas Klinger, who is head of remote at AngelList, summarized this as: "Returns optionally" \-\> leadership goes back \-\> trips from remote-first to poorly run hybrid \-\> stop outside of special areas.
- **Some will go all remote**.
  - Some companies will go all remote, part of them are already canceling their leases during the pandemic, and another part will do so after finding out that hybrid is complex. Most of these will be successful, which is terrific for the world.
  - There is so much talent outside of the major metro areas, and all of these people can suddenly compete for the high-paying and rewarding jobs at the world's leading companies.
- **Compensation**
  - Companies will pay market rates based on your location (see link). Rates outside of major metro areas will increase.
- **Reporting. No matrix.**
  - At GitLab, much of the work is multi-disciplinary, but we don't have the different disciplines report to the same manager. Instead, we have stable counterparts, and we require each hire to be a 'manager of one' who can self-organize without a project manager. [Here is how we do it.](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/leadership/#no-matrix-organization)

Whether you believe this or not, you are remote right now and will be for several more months, if not years. You might as well try to get good at it. We challenge you to become an expert at it. If you do, and you conclude that all remote is better, you can declare that you are all remote forever. And if you do that, you instantly get the prizes of all remote. What are they?

You get to start recruiting for open positions from anywhere in the world. It is hard to describe just how beneficial this is until you experience it. On May 20, 2020, Brian Armstrong declared that [Coinbase would be remote-first post-COVID](https://blog.coinbase.com/post-covid-19-coinbase-will-be-a-remote-first-company-cdac6e621df7). This move instantly allowed the company to start recruiting from anywhere in the world. And within 30 days, Brian declared to me (Matt) that they resolved all of Coinbase's recruiting challenges. Going remote was the single answer\!

But let's get back to the problems of remote. If you can solve these, then you get to receive the All Remote prizes.

The primary problems seem to be:

- Social bonding
- Mental Health
- Collaboration

Social bonding

If my team members trust and like each other, then when issues and friction arise, each person's first assumption is that the other is well-meaning, "we are on the same team," and we can find a mutually beneficial solution. We all know that trust and like amongst team members creates a more functional work environment. If, by contrast, trust and like do not exist, then minor friction quickly escalates into anger and dysfunction.

In the in-person world, we foster trust and like through social bonding. We say hello and goodbye, have occasional informal conversations to connect as human beings. We talk about interests outside of work (in the hallway, over drinks or food, or at an offsite event) and generally see each other doing work (and feel the comfort that work was getting done).

But in a remote world, we don't say hello and goodbye to each other each day, informal communications don't occur unless we intentionally create them, and we don't see each other doing work.

What is the solution?

In a remote world, we must intentionally create the interactions that naturally happen in an in-person world. And if we do so, we can make them more effective than the organic ones that naturally arose before.

Here are the things that Gitlab does to [formalize informal communications](https://twitter.com/sytses/status/1250946875143815168).

Taking a step back from the tactics, let's ask, "What creates human connection?"

Matt believes that it's when ...

- You know what is important to me.

  - You take the time to get to know me as a human.
    - At first superficially: My name and some of the important things to me outside of work (my spouse, kids, pets, hobbies, where I grew up, went to school, etc.)
    - And then more deeply: A dream that I have, a trauma that I have experienced, what makes me feel anger or fear, what I feel shame about, etc.
  - You recognize and call out the emotions or thoughts that I am experiencing.
    - If I feel pain, anger, fear, or sadness, you reach out to me to confirm my feelings and thoughts. Once you have confirmed it, you help me clarify my thoughts when communicating with others.

- That you know what is essential to the organization

  - You take the time to understand the priorities of the organization.
    - You read the Wiki.
    - You know what the company Vision and quarterly company OKRs are. You can recite them.
    - You know the Product Roadmap and the Customer Profile/Problem, no matter what part of your organization.

- That you intend to take care of issues that are important to our organization and me.

  - Now that you know what is essential to the company and me, I believe that you intend to act in service of those things. You show this to me by specifically describing how what you are doing supports mine and the company's priorities.
  - I gain further comfort in your intention by seeing you in multiple situations, and your behavior remains consistent. The magic number is usually five. Once I see you in five different settings or physical locations, I usually tell myself that I know your character. The amount of time I see you in these settings or locations almost doesn't matter. Five minutes is nearly as valuable as five hours.

- That you are competent.
  - To achieve this care, you understand what the most important thing to do is (insightful), can take the time and space to do it (organized), and you do it well (skilled).
    - We have already covered insight above.
    - For organization, I either see you getting things done or using a system that I know to be effective (i.e., Getting Things Done by David Allen, Monday.com, Asana, etc.).
    - For skill, I simply judge your work. But if you know my interest, show that you addressed it and organized it… that is 90% of the performance I am looking for.
  - For most people, it's important to laugh and have fun. If you create this for me, you are taking care of me. But you don't need to be a comedian. If you organize an event where I have fun, I give you as much credit as the comic who made me laugh.
  - Most people love to talk about themselves, as well as the people and topics they hold dear. You need not have any prior knowledge of these topics. You need only ask, be willing to listen to the answers, and appear to be interested.

So, to create a human connection, create moments where people can;

- Get to know each other as humans, both the superficial details of their life and the more serious ones.
