The essence of my coaching is to prove to you that when you feel fear or anger, your brain gives you bad advice. Whenever you notice that you are experiencing fear/anger, therefore, my recommendation is that you do one of the following:

- "Shift" out of fear/anger before deciding what to do. And in the meantime, take no action.

  **OR**

- If there is urgency and you must act immediately (which is almost never the case), do exactly the opposite of what your brain is recommending.

- If you are in Anger, and your brain is telling you to crush this person who has wronged you, instead get curious about why they did what they did.

  - This action does not mean that you don't subsequently end your relationship with this person. It just means that you first genuinely seek to understand why they did what they did. There are lessons there for you because you likely had a hand in creating the situation.

- If you are in Fear, and you want to not do an action for fear of the perceived consequences (i.e., give someone blunt feedback), instead do the action (provide them with feedback ... in a kind way).

  - Once again, it doesn't mean that there is no risk to the decision. It's just likely that the benefit outweighs the risk. And that the unwanted outcome is likely not as dire as you imagine it to be.

Now, of course, you will be saying, "Why? What proof do you have that my brain gives me bad advice when I am in anger or fear?" The write-up below is my attempt to give you that evidence. But the best way is to try the suggestions above one time and see how things turn out. My prediction is that they will turn out well, and then you will not even need to read the rest of this write-up.

But in case you still want to read more ...

The pre-frontal cortex (located in the frontal lobe) is the part of our brain that is generally credited for problem-solving and creative thought. The amygdala (situated near the basal stem and often referred to as "the reptile brain") is that part of our brain which generates the emotion of fear or Anger (when presented with new, risky, or threatening stimuli).

In his book [The Righteous Mind](https://smile.amazon.com/Righteous-Mind-Divided-Politics-Religion/dp/0307455777/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2WHXK8E7987V2&keywords=the+righteous+mind&qid=1566517365&s=books&sprefix=the+righteous%2Cstripbooks%2C193&sr=1-1), John Haidt argues convincingly that human thought starts with an emotion. We react to external stimuli with an emotion (joy, sadness, fear, etc.). Then our powerful brain comes up with a story or perceived-fact pattern that explains our feelings. Once we create this story, [confirmation bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias) causes us to see facts that further support our story, only hardening our belief in its "truth."

Emotions are valuable and intelligent signals for us. Fear signals that there is something new here or something potentially risky. It is helpful for us to be aware of that so that we don't proceed recklessly ahead. Similarly, anger signals that there is something that is potentially harming us or those around us. It is valuable for us to be aware of this so that we don't allow it to continue unabated.

But that is where the intelligence of fear and anger ends. Our rational brain will create a story that justifies fear or anger. This story is usually a prediction that some horrible things will happen if we do an action (or don't do an action). The evolutionary value of fear is that it kept humans alive in a world where risk (the presence of a wild animal) or newness (an unknown berry) often led to death. By preventing humans from proceeding in those situations, fear kept humans alive. So whatever story the mind created to justify the fear contributed to keeping humans alive. A similar pattern existed for anger.

That was then. In the modern world, the stories that fear creates do prevent us from acting. They do preserve our ego. But they also have a tremendous opportunity cost. By not acting, we never know if the board member that we do not have trust with would step down if we asked them, or whether the person in a critical role who is not performing well (but whom we think we cannot afford to have quit) would start performing if we gave them kind-hearted direct feedback.

When we encounter the unknown, fear predicts that something terrible will happen if we move forward. (Anger predicts that bad things will continue to happen unless we move forward.) But, by definition, we cannot be sure of what will happen in the future. There is a chance that something good will result from the action. If we think about that possibility for several minutes and allow ourselves to breathe deeply, fear often turns into excitement.

And if we do move forward, we often discover that either our negative predictions don't materialize. Or, if they do, the result is still better than the current state. And when that happens, hopefully, we also have the thought: "Fear (or anger) was giving me bad advice. I'm glad I didn't follow it."

If you are convinced that the above is true, you may be thinking: "Yeah, but how do I catch myself? When I'm in fear or anger, I don't realize it at the moment. I act. It's only much later that I realize it."

This awareness is a big challenge. You can spend years meditating, and it will provide marginal benefit in your ability to notice when you are in fear or anger. Or you can outsource this function to those around you.

I far prefer the latter. I have asked everyone I live with (my wife and children) and work with to signal me when they perceive me to be in fear or anger. The words that seem to be the most effective with me are "I perceive you to be in anger." When I hear that, I can immediately stop. (By contrast, if they say "You're in anger" or "Are you in anger?", I feel more anger.)

If you are unconvinced that the writings above are accurate, there is a way to test them. Make a bet with someone. The next time someone perceives you to be in fear (this particular test works better with fear than anger), make a bet with them. Your brain will be making a prediction: "If I do X, then Y will happen." Their brain will be making a different prediction, Z, which is likely the opposite of Y. Then, do the action and see what happens. I posit that the other person will win the bet.

## I have made these bets hundreds of times with people that I perceive to be in fear. I have yet to lose.

(This next idea comes from Regina Gerbeaux, COO at Mochary Method)

Fear Journaling

Or, if there is no one that you feel comfortable making a bet with, then make a bet with yourself. To do this, create a Fear Journal. Whenever you feel fear, or someone tells you that they perceive you to be in fear, write down what prediction your brain is making. Do this regularly so that you are able to make many predictions. Then, a week or a month or a year later, go back and read the predictions that you made. See how many of them actually came true. And if any came true, ask yourself if that outcome was actually negative.

My posit is that very few, if any, of them will come true. And those that do will actually turn out to be net positive.
