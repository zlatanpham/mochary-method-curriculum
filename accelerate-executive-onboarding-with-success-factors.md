Congratulations\! You’ve just hired a top-tier executive for your scaling organization. But what comes next?

For many startup CEOs, onboarding typically means having the new hire read countless reports and meet with team members. But that approach often falls flat—it doesn't provide the deep integration or momentum that new executives need to succeed quickly.

Instead, strategic onboarding is critical to ensure your new executive seamlessly aligns with your company’s mission, culture, and leadership team. Research from The Boston Consulting Group and Spencer Stuart shows that _companies with well-structured onboarding programs achieve 2.5 times the profit growth and 1.9 times higher profit margins_ compared to those without such programs.

One powerful method for fostering this alignment is [Shadowing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FwrvtGTdhCbxparQ3a4y7Z5RidSHXzsZORoGTubcY3U/edit?usp=sharing), as outlined by Matt Mochary. Having your new executive shadow you for an extended period of time is amazingly effective at helping them gain a deep understanding of your company’s mission, culture, team dynamics, and operations.

But how can you make the shadowing process even more impactful?

#### **Many of my CEO clients and their new hires have found success by incorporating the “Success Factors” approach during the shadowing phase.**

This method accelerates your new executive’s effectiveness by emphasizing the critical elements necessary for their success.

**What are Success Factors?**

Success Factors are the key elements that must be in place for your executive to excel.

Some of these Success Factors, like building trusting relationships with peers, are universal and backed by research. Others may be specific to your organization, such as understanding the legacy of leaders who have previously held the role, or mastering the nuances of your company’s operational systems.

By identifying and articulating these Success Factors, you, your new executive, and the organization can work together to create an environment primed for success from day one.

#### **How to Implement Success Factors**

1. **Customize the Success Factors Table**: Start by reviewing the table below and tailoring it to fit your unique situation. Ideally, this should be a collaborative effort involving your executive team and the new hire.
2. **Cover All Bases**: Ensure you address social, cultural, and professional factors that support your new hire’s success. Consider often-overlooked factors like cultural familiarization, peer relationship development, alignment with the company’s core promise, and team dynamics understanding.
3. **Regular Reviews**: Review the Success Factors weekly with your new executive during the shadowing period—and beyond\! This continuous check-in ensures alignment and ongoing improvement. Discuss each factor, review progress and learnings, identify challenges, and adjust the onboarding and development plans as needed.
4. **Adjust Over Time**: As the executive settles into their role, refine the Success Factors to include specific areas of opportunity. For example, one of my clients incorporates elements from 360-degree feedback into the Success Factors to ensure continued growth.

#### **Success Factors Example**

The following table, grounded in research from talent firms like Egon Zehnder and Spencer Stuart, provides examples of key Success Factors my clients use, along with the necessary actions to achieve them.
