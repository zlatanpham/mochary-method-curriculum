Is your team slowing down? As companies grow, that startup hunger—when everything moved fast and everyone was energized—often fades. Decisions take longer, focus drifts, and things feel sluggish. But a small shift in your meetings can bring that drive back.

Many CEOs face this: as teams grow, things get complicated. Silos form, focus gets scattered, and speed is lost. But with the right meeting structure, you can restore that startup energy.The Solution: Momentum Meetings

Originally laid out in Bain & Company’s _The Founder’s Mentality_, "Momentum Meetings" are a simple Monday-Tuesday rhythm designed to bring back your team’s energy and speed. Momentum Meetings help your team:

- Stay laser-focused on the **core mission**
- Sharpen and scale your **competitive advantage**
- Quickly **unblock issues** that slow you down

### Monday Momentum Meeting: Refocus, Build, and Unblock

Start your week by setting the tone with a Monday Momentum Meeting. Here’s how:

1. **State the Core Mission**
   - This keeps the team aligned on the “why” behind your company.
   - Example: “Deliver high-quality products that improve everyday life.”
2. **Zero in on Your Competitive Advantage**
   - Identify what sets you apart in the delivery of your mission..
   - Example: Superior delivery speed AND unbeatable product quality.
   - Ask: How can we scale this 100x?
3. **Raise Blockers (Anyone Can Speak)**
   - Create an open space where **anyone** can raise issues that jeopardize the competitive advantage.
   - Blockers can be anything: a process bottleneck, communication gap, or logistics snafus.
4. **Assign Clear Action Plans**
   - The team works together cross-functionally until every issue or blocker has a clear action plan with a designated owner.
   - Example: If delivery times are slow, assign someone to research better logistics solutions.
   - **No one leaves the meeting until every issue or blocker has an action item and owner against it.**

_Pro Tip: Involve the Customer_

- Bring **customer feedback** into the meeting. It keeps everyone focused on delivering value.
- If possible, have someone represent the customer’s voice in the room, sharing insights from real feedback.

**Key Elements for Monday Momentum Meeting:**

- **Attendees:** Cross-functional leaders, customer-facing team members; all the functions that are needed to deliver on the mission/competitive advantage
- **Name the Core Mission:** Align everyone to the company’s main goal.
- **Name your Competitive Advantage:** Focus on scaling what makes you unique.
- **Raise all Blockers:** Open floor for anyone to raise issues.

#### Tuesday Momentum Meeting: Keep the Pace Up

Tuesdays are about maintaining momentum. This is a quick check-in to ensure:

- **Action Items from Monday are progressing.**
- **New Blockers are addressed quickly.**

**Speed and Focus stay intact.**

- _Example: If Monday's action was to explore new logistics partners, Tuesday's meeting checks on progress. If new blockers arise, resolve them immediately._

**Key Elements for Tuesday Momentum Meeting:**

- **Action Review:** Check progress on Monday's tasks.
- **New Blockers:** Identify and solve any fresh issues.
- **Rapid Iteration:** Stay flexible and keep adjusting as needed.

**The Power of Weekly Cadence**

By running Momentum Meetings every week, you’ll create a rhythm that:

- Keeps the team **focused** on the mission
- Continually sharpens your **competitive edge**
- Ensures blockers are addressed before they slow you down

Of course, if you already have elements of this in place in your regular rhythm of business, just take what you need to sharpen your approach\!
