[Loudest voice in the room](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OKJnyxUZDOcPQF0VtERizzyvKgBiqwOA7aL2dMcFSdw/edit) (1 min)

(This writing was inspired by a conversation with Anthony Ghosn, CEO of Hearth.)

As CEO, your voice is the "loudest in the room." To get full buy-in, you will have to elicit people's most genuine thoughts. Once people hear your perspective, some percentage will naturally alter their views to more closely match yours. This % is much higher than you might imagine. People assume that as CEO, you have more information than they do, and therefore your perspective is probably more correct. Later, these same people will not feel fully bought-in to the outcome, because internally they will know that their true thought was not heard.

So, to get the full benefit of your team's knowledge and make sure that they get to full buy-in, be careful not to "tip your hand" before all others have shared theirs. The most effective way to do this is to either have people write down their vote or thoughts before you share your perspective. Or by having everyone give a simultaneous thumbs-up/thumbs-down vote.

For an excellent example of this phenomenon and the solution, CJ Reim of Amity Ventures pointed me to [_13 Days_](https://smile.amazon.com/Thirteen-Days-Memoir-Missile-Crisis/dp/0393318346/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1501172138&sr=1-1&keywords=13+days) by Robert F Kennedy about the Cuban Missile Crisis.

From Peter Reinhardt, CEO and co-founder of Segment: "Apparently at Amazon, they require the most junior people to speak and ask questions first. Also becomes a great way to show off junior talent, give more senior folks a chance to observe and give feedback, etc."

To make this process even more efficient, use [Brainstorming written](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zHmVPz0gVQqXctk5w2oKs8cQTLw6uprbPgQZaoO3HT0/edit#) (2 min to read). Simply state the problem, and ask your team (for 3 minutes) to write in their proposed solutions.
