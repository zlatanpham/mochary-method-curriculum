#### 1st Meeting Template

##### Meeting info

- Meeting owner: Report
- Desired outcome of meeting:
  - Accountability, Coaching and Transparency (ACT) between Report and Manager
- Prep work:
  - Write Good Things, Update and Issues ahead of time.
  - Read each other’s Good Things, Update and Issues ahead of time and comment.

##### Connection (Good Things)

- ###### _Instructions_

  - If a team is fully remote, then informal chat about personal lives rarely happens. I like to build in 5 minutes of this in a hyper-efficient way by asking each participant to take 30 seconds to share a highlight from their personal lives.
  - Without this step or something like it, teams will lose personal connection and trust over time.

  - The most important part of operating is planning and accountability, which is declaring what each of us is going to do, and confirming that we did what we said we would. As important as this is, oddly it can be written and reviewed entirely asynchronously and therefore does not need to take up any valuable synchronous meeting time.
  - An update includes (this is often separated into a separate meeting called a Review)

##### Coaching (Issues and Topics)

- ###### _Instructions_

  - Issues (this is often separated into its own meeting called a Decision meeting)

    - [Issue / Proposed Solution template (group)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jOoTu44L22LG-_DfnTNdscBg2EJ_dSZgTujc5utK4yc/edit#heading=h.b81xwnfqvmsc)
    - When someone presents an Issue, I want to hear them describe it verbally so that I can know what emotion they are experiencing (fear, anger, joy, excitement, etc.), as I am likely to trust their Proposed Solution much more if they are experiencing the positive emotions that lead to brain activity in the pre-frontal cortex.

        - [Fear and Anger give bad advice](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sDWHUm6zwEGiPBQH2Ig6DDvVL-IEQSlfNeQnR2mhjmE/edit) (3 min)

    - As Decision-Maker, I
      - Read through all comments (and thank each author as I finish reading their section) and then ask for verbal presentation of the ones that seem most interesting and relevant.
      - If I have enough information, declare my decision.
      - If I don’t have enough information, declare what information I need, who will get it and by when, and then schedule the date when I will make the decision.

  - While we give it as a gift, it is not always received that way. I want to know how it is received in real-time so that if the recipient gets triggered I can jump in and declare that I did not intend to anger them.
