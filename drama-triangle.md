## [The Drama Triangle](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19Zg0OfkR5-EXyiL8Zd8sfiCWl1D3h89eO_OPgF7Fdqc/edit#)

When we discuss challenges or issues as a group, we often suffer from two bad habits:

1\. We believe that we know the correct answer and try to convince others to see our point of view.

2\. We never truly share our deepest, darkest thoughts and feelings for fear of offending others.

This pattern often leads us down a negative pathway and causes the following problems:

1\. We cannot fully see other perspectives, so we don't get complete information.

2\. Others never fully appreciate our perspective because we haven't fully shared it.

To elicit your team's full potential, though, you must create an environment where ideas can flow freely. The following exercise, called The Drama Triangle, will encourage your team members to share fully by allowing them the safety of distancing themselves from their perspectives. To apply it to a situation or conflict, have each person stand up one at a time and declare a Hero, Victim, and Villain by answering the following questions:

\- Hero:

**"I temporarily solve the situation by \_\_\_\_\_\_."**

\- Victim:

**"I am negatively affected by this in the following ways:\_\_\_\_\_\_."**

**"I am powerless to permanently solve this situation because:\_\_\_\_\_\_."**

\- Villain:

**"I blame (name of a real person) for creating this situation by doing (real action)."**

Each person continues this cycle, blaming a new person each time until no one is left to blame for that issue. (Remember, you can also blame yourself\!)

Then everybody answers this question: **"Are you willing to easefully and playfully resolve this issue in this meeting?"**

The group then moves to brainstorm solutions.

In my experience, it is easy to come up with elegant and complete solutions once all of the "worst" information is on the table and nothing remains hidden.

I highly recommend using a knowledgeable outsider to facilitate this meeting, at least for the first time. They will keep your team on a script. If anyone goes off-script and gets angry, the results can be very messy.
