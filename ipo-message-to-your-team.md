[IPO: message to your team](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oWVdHPK5vuzfOK4Onojo9xjYBFvaM18cNxLk9wVcJxI/edit) (1 min)

The day after you go public, I recommend that you send the following letter (or something like it) to the entire company:

Yesterday, we went public. At the end of the trading day, the market valued our company at \_\_\_\_.

And that is the last time I ever intend to talk about our valuation. Because talking about it, or even thinking about it, will never add any value to our business. But it may well take away from our business by inducing anxiety or distraction.

Mr. Market is a wild beast. And he will have wildly fluctuating views of our value. None of them are real. And each of them shall pass.

There will come a day when our stock price will suddenly tank. And on that day, I hope that each of us will ...

- Look at our Mission, Vision, Values, OKRs ... and do the next highest priority action on our list.

There will also come a day when our stock price will suddenly soar. And on that day, I hope that each of us will ...

- Look at our Mission, Vision, Values, OKRs ... and do the next highest priority action on our list.

In fact, my true hope is that none of us will even know if our stock price is soaring or tanking. I hereby commit to not looking at our stock price for the next three months to lead the way. I hope you will do the same. But even if you don't, please do not talk about it with me or anyone else in the company.

We capture our North Star in our Mission, Vision, Values, and OKRs. And nowhere in there have we written … "think about our stock price."
