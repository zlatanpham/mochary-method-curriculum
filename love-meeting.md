[Love Meeting](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YcZz5WQlIzIhRWL37Knha6eutCkBMXv8KAIFZl5IdPs/edit) (5 min including video)

People who feel emotions strongly (anger, fear, sadness) need an effective way to release those emotions. One of the most effective ways is to speak aloud for a few minutes about what is causing them anger, fear, or sadness. Once they do this, much of the emotion is released, and they feel better.

Most people benefit from such a release after a long day of living (work, kids, etc.). If you have a spouse or a partner, one of the greatest gifts you can give them is an offer to be the listener for such a release.

If you make such an offer and it is accepted, the key is to be "present" while your partner talks and not interject with suggestions or advice. If you give advice, you kill the person's stream of consciousness and end the release. This action is very frustrating for the talker. They don't want solutions; they just want to release.

So, your only job during such a session is to listen actively.

In its most basic form, active listening is:

- Being present

  - Turn off all devices (phone, laptop, etc.)
  - Look at the person talking
  - Breath

- Not interjecting
  - Do not talk\!
  - Do not give advice or suggestions.
  - Just listen\!

In a more advanced form, you can show that you hear both the words and their emotions. When your partner expresses something frustrating, allow yourself to feel the frustration and allow your face to reflect that emotion. Similarly, for sadness, anger, and fear, or whatever emotion they are expressing.

As the listener, it may feel daunting to be present and listen for an indeterminate amount of time. What if your partner keeps talking for hours? The answer, of course, is that they won't. Usually, after 10-15 minutes, your partner will likely be talked out, emotionally released, and feeling much better (and feeling connected to you\!).

The first time you do this, I recommend that you just let it go as long as it needs to. If you decide to make this a regular part of your life, know that it will require less and less time over time.

For a visual demonstration of what to and not to do (and why), watch this 2-minute video called [Nail in the Head](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-4EDhdAHrOg).

I call such a listening meeting a Love Meeting. My wife and I do it regularly. And it magically creates a deep connection between us.
