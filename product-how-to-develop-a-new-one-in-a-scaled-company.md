Achieving product-market fit for a new product when you only have 2-3 people in your company (i.e., a YC startup) is hard. Doing it when your company has hundreds of people is damn near impossible. Why? And is there a better way?\!

To understand this dynamic, let's look at product development through three broad stages of company development:

Stage 1: Building

In this stage, 2-3 founders (YC startup size) prototype a product and find product-market fit. There is no brand equity to worry about and no real concerns about security or scalability (because there are no real users yet). The development team is small enough to move fast and break things without the burden of commenting, testing, and hardening their code. All they care about is getting feedback from their customers, experimenting, and iterating as fast as possible. This allows them to learn and optimize their solution very quickly.

Stage 2: Scaling

Once the company finds product-market fit, they begin to sign customers and grow the team. The product now needs to be secure and scalable. The team needs to onboard new engineers, so the code needs to be commented on and tested. The company begins to develop a brand and a reputation that they need to protect, so they want high confidence that new features work well before being deployed. All of this necessarily slows down the pace of development and deployment.

Stage 3: Broadening

Now the company wants to broaden the product portfolio, so they need to build new products. The problem is that the team's DNA is now oriented towards protecting the brand, so a new product will take a long time before it's good enough for sharing. The developers are used to building scalable and clean code, which takes longer than rough prototypes. Under these constraints, it's impossible to get customer feedback and learn quickly enough. Other newer and smaller startups will learn 10x faster and beat them every time.

Solution:

The only way to successfully build a new product within a scaled company is to recreate the early-stage building mode. This means taking a team of 3-5 dedicated people and making them autonomous. This regains all the build fast elements of the YC startup. No brand, no customers, no need for security, scalability, or industrial code.

(At the extreme end, this means putting the team in an entirely new C corp \[wholly owned by the parent\], with a new name and therefore no brand to protect.)

This new group will still require a "founder mentality." And it is hard to hire true founders because they're usually founding companies. (Although, it is worth trying to find x-founders whose companies didn’t succeed, and they now want to join a successful company.) The key is to create a founder mentality with the existing team. To create this frame of mind, every week, ask the team how they "failed." Then congratulate them on each instance because it meant that they tried, took a risk, and, most importantly, learned. This way, the team is re-trained from seeing failure as something that removes approval to something that grants approval. This is the only way they can get into the experimentation mode that rapid new product development requires.

Wei Deng, CEO of Clipboard Health, shares that she has created a new C Corp called Billterms. The results:

- It works\!
- Customers aren’t trying to push requests about the base Clipboard product, because they aren’t talking to Clipboard, they’re talking to Billterms. So problem-discovery is focused entirely on Billterms.
- Also, we can experiment wildly because the brand isn’t associated with Clipboard at all. If someone has a negative experience with one tool, they are still willing to try the other tool.
- We’ve actually created a separate C Corp for each of the 4 new products that we are building.
- My next experiment is to bring each of these new product teams to work together in person. The rest of the company is remote, but I think new product development happens better and faster in person.

This method works well for rebuilding the existing core product as well. Technology moves quickly. There comes a point when rebuilding the core product will produce better results than continuing to add on to the existing version. But it can often take 6-18 months to rebuild the now-large tool. Therefore, continue to staff the core product, and treat v2 as a new product and therefore a new company.

This is common practice. I can think of 4 companies that I coach that have completely rebuilt their core product. And one that rebuilds its core product every 12-24 months.
