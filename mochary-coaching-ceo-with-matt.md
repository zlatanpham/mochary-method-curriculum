The cost of working with Matt is high: **$15,000** per month. If that doesn’t turn your stomach, then please keep reading …

## Why get coaching at all?

Many people report to you. And, theoretically, they perform better because of it.

But you report to no one. Yes, you report to the board, but not really. You don’t share with them everything, and therefore they are not your true thought partners.

When we work together, you will report to me. If after 3 meetings, your life is better, then you know that the Mochary methodology works. It is all captured in the [Mochary Method Curriculum](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18FiJbYn53fTtPmphfdCKT2TMWH-8Y2L-MLqDk-MFV4s/edit), so feel free to use that with your team. For a more book-like presentation, see [The Great CEO Within (online)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZJZbv4J6FZ8Dnb0JuMhJxTnwl-dwqx5xl0s65DE3wO8/edit). Those who have read these docs tell us that we should make them required reading before coaching anyone. For now, though, that’s still only a suggestion.

To make our meetings more efficient, we have created [Defacto](https://beta.mocharymethod.com/home) software. If you find the software effective, feel free to use it with your reports as well.

## Step 1: You \+ an observer

We will have **an initial 1-1 meeting of 2 hours.**

In the first hour, we will prepare for the meeting:

- Align on your top priorities (maximum 3\)
- Complete your first meeting pre-write.

In the second hour, we will have the actual meeting using this structure:

- [Meetings: How to make them effective and efficient](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1m4tP-ZtTg2OkHgu8dih4qzNSXtp9zrwS5o_Blrs6_Sk/edit) (4 min)

If we create value, we will schedule **two more meetings**, ideally spaced 2-4 weeks apart, of 80 minutes each. We will include your [Chief of Staff](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-tcubUwvktoV-Ou3bB6ynk2LLwNzdT3D_p_ILreyR_A/edit#) (as an observer) if you have one. If you don’t have one, I strongly encourage you to get one prior to us starting our coaching sessions, or appoint someone who is very operational, to observe our sessions.

Why? Because I will show you a method of managing that will highly likely resonate with you, but then you will highly likely want someone else to implement amongst your leadership team. So, let’s train that person from meeting 1\.

The system will require you to pre-write for each meeting. This will make our meetings 3x more effective than if you didn’t prepare.

By the third meeting, you feel more engaged, effective and productive. If you do, then you will know that the system and software work.

A Mochary Method coach (other than Matt) will help you prepare for each meeting in a scheduled meeting.

Typical reactions to the software are:  
Meeting 1: “Why are we using this software? Let’s just use a Google Doc, it’s easier.”  
Meeting 2: “Oh, I see why this software is better than a Google Doc. Let’s keep using it.”  
Meeting 3: “This software is awesome. Can I please use this throughout my entire company.”

## Step 2: Ongoing

We continue meeting monthly 1-1.

I will invite you to join a monthly CEO forum group of companies in your size and stage range.

And please reach out to me at any time when you are facing a challenge. Please use Defacto to both write up the issue and record audio of you describing it. I will respond near-instantly, and we can talk live if needed.

## How much does it cost?

- Coaching with Matt and use of Defacto:

  - **$15,000 per month**.
  - Monthly coaching sessions with Matt.
  - Ongoing monthly CEO forum meetings with Matt.
  - Unlimited async access to Matt through Defacto.
  - Use of Defacto for up to 150 seats.
    - Additional seats are $100/user/month.

- Initial payment
  - After our first coaching session, if we create value together and want to continue, I will ask you to make first payment yourself (ie- please do not forward to your finance team, as they often take \>30 days to make first payment.) After that, my finance team can interact independently with your finance team.  

  - During the first three coaching sessions, if at any point we don’t create enough value, I will return all payments to you.
