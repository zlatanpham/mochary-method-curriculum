**Unconscious Listening**

We listen unconsciously most of the time \- with an agenda or motive that keeps us from really listening. We listen to...

- **Fix \-** Listen while attempting to fix their problem for them, responding only with solutions.
- **Diagnose \-** Analyze the circumstances, offer hypotheses, and ask questions to clarify your theories.
- **Defend \-** Listen for how the person has misperceived the situation and respond with reframing.
- **Calm \-** Listen for how the person needs to feel relaxed and try to console them.
- **Debate \-** Listen with skepticism and respond with devil's advocacy.
- **Correct \-** Listen for where the person is incorrect, and respond with corrections, improvements, and/or criticism

**Conscious Listening**

Conscious Listening happens when the listener is aware of what's occurring at the moment for themselves and with the person they're listening to, without any alternate motives. This kind of Listening supports genuine transformation and honors the intelligence of the head, heart, and gut.

HEAD

What is the mental content within the message \- the words, thoughts, ideas, and beliefs? (**Facts** and **Stories**)

HEART

What is the emotional content that is fueling the expression \- the five core emotions are anger, sadness, fear, joy, and excitement? (**Feelings**)

GUT (For Advanced Listeners)

What is the base desire behind the content \- what is wanted, longed for, or needed? (**Desires**)

**Conscious \+ Active Listening**

- I hear you saying that… (facts), and you have a story/thought that… (story). It sounds like you feel... (feelings) and you really want... (desires).
- Did I get that right?
- Is there more?

_Note: In practice, I often simply share back the story/thought \+ feelings. I hear you saying that… (story/thought), and it sounds like you're feeling... (feeling)._

Signs that someone is being consciously listened to:

- More color in the face
- More flow of feeling and/or a burst of energy
- An exhale or relaxation of breath
- A more natural or relaxed pace in the conversation
