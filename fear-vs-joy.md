[Fear vs Joy](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mZqiTrDF6bcQYa3UFEKTqkuyyTHJCI_rpd173VubJ64/edit) (3 min)

Fear is an excellent motivator. It fueled humanity in times of scarcity. And continues to do so now in times of abundance.

Many of us fear failure, but even more of us fear being viewed as a failure. This fear of failure drives us to work maniacally to achieve.

But as good a motivator as fear is, there is a better one: Joy. For proof of this, find someone who has achieved joy in their work-life (admittedly, they are rare) and ask them whether they are more motivated and more successful when fueled by fear. I'm sure you can guess their answer: Far more motivated, far more successful, and most importantly … feeling peaceful and satisfied all day every day.

This path, of course, sounds like something reserved for only those who already have made it financially. And there certainly is a high correlation to those who achieve this state with prior financial success, but that is not causation. It is merely a forcing function.

Most people dream of financial success. They tell themselves: "When I achieve wealth, all will be well. I will be happy; life will be good." Then they achieve financial success, but no happiness, peace, or satisfaction arrives. It exposes this dream as a false one. Now, these people have no choice but to go in search of peace elsewhere. Some of them eventually find their "purpose" and experience true and lasting joy, satisfaction, and peace for the first time in their lives.

When hearing this, people say: "But if I lose fear, won't I simply decide that making money is pointless and then go sit on a beach for the rest of my life?" The answer is: "If you're not careful about how you transition from fear to joy, then yes."

I view Fear and Joy as motivation mountains. If you lose Fear before you discover Joy in your work, then you will indeed fall into a motivation valley and may not have any motivation to continue at work. It is then quite possible to get stuck there and not be able to climb out.

The key, therefore, is to discover Joy in your work first. The best way that I know to do this is the [**Energy Audit**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HmaRdtk8R5GQtMj72Y6XhHTru5SQAiiqDfDP3qy73k4/edit?usp=drive_web&ouid=102503928790226855337). Once you are experiencing Joy at work daily, it is safe to move on to losing Fear. And the best ways to lose Fear that I know of are [Consciousness Training options](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lcUnr_vQIW3TI7rUl5RwthyUPU032dFXAw3ccbOE48I/edit). (The link is currently only available to those whom I coach due to sensitive information.)

What welcomes you on the other side of this effort is daily Joy (even bliss) at work and in all of your life, as well as a massive success, because you will continue in your work for decades and decades, which in the end will bring far more success and a short fear-fueled sprint.

Enjoy\!

Btw, if you currently find yourself in a motivation valley, all is not lost. There is a way out. It is the [**Energy Audit**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HmaRdtk8R5GQtMj72Y6XhHTru5SQAiiqDfDP3qy73k4/edit?usp=drive_web&ouid=102503928790226855337). But you may not have much that gives you energy. That's OK. Do the exercise regularly, and you will begin to discover things that provide you with energy. At first, a little bit of energy, and then later massive amounts of it.
