[Matt describing how to get done the first two minutes of all actions](https://www.loom.com/share/7bca40c0fc494d9ea81395edbc42030e) (4 min)

1. ## **Frank Slootman’s “Bias to Action” (from Amp It Up)**

   1. In meetings, team members often commit to deadlines like: "I'll do this by next week."
   2. Slootman’s challenge: "Why can’t you get it done by tomorrow?"
   3. Core Idea: Speeding up actions accelerates the entire company’s momentum.

2. ## **Taking It One Step Further: “Why Not Right Now?”**

   1. Problem: The hardest part of any task is starting.
   2. Solution: Begin the first two minutes of every agreed-upon action during the meeting.
   3. Tactic: Reserve the last 10 minutes of every meeting to initiate action steps.

3. ## **Two Types of Actions and How to Handle Them**

   1. ### **Actions You Can Do Yourself**

      1. If it takes less than 2 minutes: Do it immediately.
      2. If it takes more than 2 minutes:
         1. Estimate the time required.
         2. Create a calendar event with the action as the title (e.g., "Write client proposal – 30 mins").

   2. ### **Actions That Involve Someone Else**

      1. #### **_Option 1: Existing Scheduled Meeting_**

         1. If you already have a meeting scheduled with them:
         2. Add the action item to the meeting agenda.
         3. Tip: Maintain a notes section listing people you regularly meet with, listing discussion points under their names.

      2. #### **_Option 2: No Upcoming Meeting_**

         1. If informing them takes less than 2 minutes: Send the message immediately.
         2. If it takes more than 2 minutes:
            1. Estimate the time (e.g., 15 minutes for a detailed email).
            2. Block that time on your calendar to complete the task.

4. ## **Why This Method Works**

   1. Immediate Momentum: Starting makes follow-through easier.
   2. Snowball Effect: Small beginnings lead to self-sustaining progress.
   3. Faster Execution: Tasks move forward without delay.

5. ## **Bottom Line**

   1. At the end of every meeting:
      1. Do it now – if it’s quick (\<2 minutes).
      2. Schedule time – if it’s longer (\>2 minutes).
      3. Add to agenda – if you’ll discuss it in an upcoming meeting.
      4. Message now or schedule messaging time – if it involves others.
   2. This bias toward immediate action ensures faster execution, natural momentum, and improved productivity.
