[Meetings: don’t schedule them](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GJ7rk_XKsOQEQqN4pGTIvc4quBCuh6p4LtmCqNFs0e4/edit) (1 min)

The two most available people that I know are Sam Altman and Naval Ravikant. At any time of day, if I reach out to them, they respond near-instantly and are usually available for a 5-minute phone chat if needed.

How is this possible? These are two of the most successful people on the planet. Shouldn’t their time be massively scheduled?

No. Sam and Naval both use the same method. They don’t schedule meetings.

This leaves their calendar almost entirely open. And that allows them to be able to respond and talk to anyone at any time. And it allows them to talk to many more people, because each conversation usually only requires 3-5 minutes.

But if they were to schedule calls, those same calls would be 25 minutes. The scheduling would also rob Sam and Naval of the flexibility to do what they want to, when they want to.

If someone wants to reach Sam or Naval, that person need only message them and say “Sam, I’d like to talk to you about \_\_\_\_\_\_. Do you have a few minutes to talk now?” If the subject is interesting to Sam, and he is free, he will call the person right then and there.

So, if you want the freedom to do what you want when you want to, and be much more available to the world, then … don’t schedule meetings\!
