As companies grow, they hit known stages with associated known problems. Luckily, for each, there is also a known solution. Here are some of those stages, problems, and solutions.

There aren't many information-sharing or relationship-building problems when a company is small (\<20 people) and in person. Everyone runs into everyone else, grocks the challenges the others face, and gains trust and familiarity with each other.

Once the company goes remote, or \>20 people in person, then the story changes. Now, no one is casually running into each other. Get-to-know-you-as-a-human conversations ("Did you do anything fun this weekend?") happen with some but not all people on the team. People no longer overhear everyone else's conversations (about company strategy, product direction, problems I'm encountering). Both of these information flows are critical. And now they must be intentionally created, or they won't happen.

This is the first challenge.

You must intentionally create a communication system that:

- Informs the entire company of the current priorities of the company, decisions that have been made, and the direction of the product.
- Informs the CEO and exec team of the problems being encountered by the team and gives them (the CEO and exec team) feedback on how they could perform better.
- Creates human connection.

If you create this system effectively, it will likely take care of all future problems, as your team will inform you of both the problems and their solutions through Issues and Feedback.

But here are some to expect:

At about 50-150 employees, you will notice that compensation does not correlate to performance across the organization. The best performers don't necessarily make more. Those who advocate for themselves best do. You will want to end this practice. To do so, you will need to create a written description of levels of seniority and the compensation associated with them in a system known as Levels and Ladder, or [Grade Level Planning](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AeS9TDfedHUGnsY2JRNCJtNsZJRCDGUssmYgz3-JLD8/edit#gid=612132548). Then when people advocate for themselves, you can simply direct them to this written guidance.

At \>500 employees, your reviews on Glassdoor will suddenly start to go down. There will be some really nasty reviews for the first time, and people will say that you are evil. It will hurt. Until you realize that it has nothing to do with reality. It is simply that many employees feel that they don't have a personal connection to you. Because of that, whenever anything happens in the company that they don't like, they will not be able to attribute positive intent to you. Instead, they will attribute negative intent. Then, because of confirmation bias, they will soon see evidence everywhere of this negative intent. They will grow to hate you. But don't despair. This is easily counteracted by beginning a process of intentional connection to all employees. It's not exciting stuff, but it is easier to achieve than you think.

Also, in the 200-1,000 people range, you will be able to hire senior executives who each have their management system. If you allow each to implement their own, you will soon have a hodge-podge, and no one from one department will be able to know what people from another department are doing. This will lead to the assumption that the other department isn't doing anything at all. Acrimony will ensure. To counter this, simply create a unified management system that all have access to. And if you do this well, you won't need those senior execs in the first place.

At this stage, product and engineering output on new features/products slow to a snail's pace. You will wistfully remember your days as a 3-person YC startup and think, "We produced a new product faster then." And you won't be wrong. The reason is that with many users comes a lot of infrastructure and security, which is a massive overhead on pushing new code, whether a bug fix or a new product. Your core product is stuck in this web. But your new products don't need to be.

At that point, the biggest issue that you will have is that your exec team doesn't like or trust each other. This again is easily solved. You have to force them to get to know each other as humans.

There will also be constant pressure from your investors, employees, and even family members to go public. Just remember that it's a one-way door. Do a little bit of diligence before you walk through it. [IPO, or not to IPO](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ond3aXqWutjbut4fBT5HBlRXBGlUZ37B0f5d2VU12RM/edit) (3 min). I recommend giving everyone liquidity through secondaries instead: [Liquidity Programs for the Company](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1z6S84UmEuggKiXVwjb00Qz633gda-6skwOS2T7iFvas/edit). But if you end up ignoring this advice, then please at least write these two letters: [IPO: Founder letter](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10QKj0H0kC_9AGNT5UKjXGw8jfUiz08Mgv6a84iDLBMI/edit) (2 min) and [IPO: message to your team](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oWVdHPK5vuzfOK4Onojo9xjYBFvaM18cNxLk9wVcJxI/edit) (1 min)
