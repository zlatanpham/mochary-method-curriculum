[Parenting as a CEO](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19BfBM6VrKzYz1snAzVFhA6ebxPGR4XYc03kfKf1qSBI/edit) (2 min)

The [CEO role](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yJhwYFf6Af0h8_xMDuKeW8d6ZomthidraqpXHI9RKRw/edit) (2 min) is full-time if you do every piece of it. Luckily, you don’t have to. You can delegate all the functions that don’t energize you.

Similarly, being a parent is full-time if you do every piece of it. Luckily, you don’t have to. You can delegate all parts of it that don’t energize you.

Unfortunately, you don’t yet know what the parenting role is exactly, so you don’t know which pieces do and don’t energize you. Therefore, hire a team of people to do all parts of the parenting role. That way, when you discover which parts energize you, you can keep doing them. And when you discover which ones don’t, there is someone there to take those over immediately.

If you have not hired such a team, then you will be stuck doing the de-energizing parenting tasks, while also recruiting your team, which will take 3-6 months.That will be a very painful 6 months. And your company will suffer during this time, because you will underperform as a CEO.

Don’t do that. Instead, over-hire.

I recommend that you hire:

- 1 full-time night nurse
- 1 full-time nanny (daytime)
- 1 weekend nanny to give time off to the FT night nurse and nanny
- 1 full-time personal Chief of Staff

Family members can play any one of those roles, as long as they actually are willing to live with you and put in the hours. Please pay them whatever you would pay a non-family member.

As in hiring for any role, hire for excellence. And be willing to pay for it. Market in the US for a top-tier night nurse is over $200,000/yr in 2021\. Be willing to pay it.

In fact, the company should pay these salaries. This team will allow you to fully perform as a CEO. There are, therefore, likely no higher-leverage employees at the company.

As you read this, you are likely thinking “This is so exaggerated. Billions of people are parents, and perform just fine in their jobs. I can too. I don’t need this insane human infrastructure that Matt is describing. I want to actually enjoy my children and look forward to spending time with them.”

## So be it. But billions of people are not trying to be CEOs of fast-growing multi-billion dollar companies. If you are, please don’t copy the behaviors of those who aren’t.
