[Relationships \- How to create a good one between a Manager and her Reports](https://docs.google.com/document/d/166UMlHgOUnKb4rgLOjFl_etT8kaey2vEFVtwaCAfdDA/edit) (3 min; 60 min for the links)

There are several ways to create a trusted relationship between a Manager and her reports.

They include:

- I notice and recognize the contributions you make.
- I ask and remember the details about you as a human being.
- I pull out of you the deepest, darkest thoughts that you have about me, the company, and your peers.
- I provide you (and all others in the company) with a universal agreement tracker.
- I ensure that you know the Mission and Vision of the company and how your OKRs help create that Vision (i.e., it won't happen without your contribution).

Let's dive deeper into each one.

Recognition

- I notice and recognize the contributions you make. This action is quite simply [Praise](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aXFhFbtIxmUdrUe9y341ghd-EJ89hJZ7g9tOKnw16FI/edit) (13 min). Do it in every single 1-1, Team Meeting and All Hands Meeting. Carve out an amount of time (3-5 minutes) to declare this praise.
- In addition, I send direct messages to people each week, or even each day, to follow up and give [appreciations](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1id4TBGwDPuCvXiEW8RvJh-ajUuhrBnayoz9D1t1Gj3Y/edit) (1 min). I block off one hour each week to do so.

Personal relationship

- I know and care about you as a human being.
  - To show this on a superficial (but still meaningful) level, I ask and remember the details about you as a human being.
    - This action creates [Trust and Like](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BQOa7foLLxNXmGUhbvkzsvm0IVYOJZTFU4MKOmreCXc/edit?usp=drive_web&ouid=102503928790226855337) (5 min).
  - Collect this information in the next 1-1 that you have with each Report.

  - In addition, start each 1-1, by saying "Before we get started, can you please give me the update on (pick one: your significant other, your kids, your hobby, etc.)." Then listen with genuine curiosity.
- I want to help you solve the challenges you face in your personal life, not just those in your work life.
  - When asking about issues that you are facing in our 1-1s, I explicitly ask you about personal challenges that you are facing. I then help you unpack those and give them as much air-time as work issues.

Darkest Thoughts

- I pull out of you the deepest, darkest thoughts that you have about me, the company, and your peers.
  - I appreciate, acknowledge, accept or not, and create actions to address the thoughts about me.
    - [Feedback](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wi714sobuQP72sKXw6J_gkwkhtVh1t6--op_Pk0YPxA/edit) (15 min)
  - On the thoughts about the company, I help you get a resolution by helping you.
    - Create a roadmap for the solution
    - Get a decision from me (if that is what is required)
    - Get a decision from higher up (if that is what is required)
      - [Issue Identification](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yfnZqztmnHatFavMqMJ40_tAN7YUcfnQgo4HrcU7SBQ/edit) (2 min)
      - [Decision-Making](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hPdWQjYfdK0SB2i3ViZ9XsMPjTYEi7Do1WI22ofmEdo/edit#heading=h.erf28nn68i0x) (8 min)
  - On the thoughts about your peers, I encourage you to address them directly. If that doesn't lead to resolution, you both clean escalate to me (I hear from both of you simultaneously), and then I adjudicate.

Universal Agreement Tracker

- I provide you (and all others in the company) with a universal agreement tracker. Here is why: [Agreement-Tracker: why you need one](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QzGvP6MrmlD6YVilTiNjEsPgRRvjzvWrqGXKSz_c68k/edit) (3 min)

How you fit into the Mission and Vision

- I ensure that you know the Mission and Vision of the company and how your OKRs help create that Vision (i.e., it won't happen without your contribution).
  - I create clear [Mission, Vision, Values: How to create them](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1L6ks72TkBIlgPDh6_n-NBBE7e_7nQ2YZ6B4BF12IQEs/edit).
  - I create with you clear OKRs: [OKR Creation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GoiH4pwsph5rwSM_wMMiMJkX6-qFVwO0SVYkodNZhwg/edit) (6 min)
  - I make sure that your OKRs map directly to the company's Mission, Vision, and Values so that you see how necessary your contribution is.
