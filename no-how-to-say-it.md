[No \- how to say it ,,. and do it](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15ZlMMBfauLT-gbgKjzOvzZQEzQdrBP_qKkXV2dfEN50/edit) (5 min)

When doing the Energy Audit, here are some of the most common things that CEOs do that don't give them energy:

- Informational meetings
- Interviews of candidates (that don't get hired)
- 1-1s with former reports
- Difficult conversations
- 1-1s that are not functional
- Group meetings that are not functional

And here are some strategies to deal with them …

####

#### Informational meetings.

Now that your company is succeeding, people want to talk to you. They ask to get a coffee together. If you don’t know the person asking, you have no obligation to respond. But some of these people may be old friends, friends of friends, or significant people in the community. You don't get energy from spending an hour with them, but you also don't want to give them the cold shoulder and gain a reputation for being aloof.

Well, there is a solution.

First, decide how much time you are willing to spend on the person.

If it is 5 minutes or less, then …

Just as most 350-page business books only contain about three pages of real information, just so most times people want to get coffee for an hour, it is simply to ask for one favor, which takes 1 minute to ask, and likely two minutes to do.

When someone emails me to get a coffee, I immediately call them. I know that they are free as they have just emailed me. They usually pick up. They are so honored that I called them quickly. I then let them know that I have just a few minutes, but I'd like to be helpful. They ask me the favor. (It is usually a request for an introduction.) I usually oblige, which takes me about two minutes. Done. The person feels honored that I responded so quickly and did what they were hoping for, and it took me less than five minutes total.

If I get the email long after they sent it, and they don't pick up when I call back, then I respond in an email: "Scheduling a coffee will take a while, but I can call you fairly soon. You are now on my call list, and I will call you when I can." I then put them on my call list and call whenever I would otherwise be listening to a podcast (i.e., in an Uber). This call usually occurs within 24-48 hours of their request. Again, they are honored by the speedy connection. And once again, the call need only last a few minutes.

If it is 1 minute or less, then …

I respond with a written email or text response. Each time I encounter a new situation and therefore write a new response, I save it. At this point, the vast majority of the time, I simply copy-paste a response that I have already written previously. Here is an example:

“Thank you for your request to …. While I am sure that I would enjoy that, I am choosing to focus my time on my top priorities, which are \_\_\_\_, \_\_\_, and \_\_\_\_. And therefore I cannot accommodate your request.”

“While I cannot meet for coffee, I would like to help if I can. What question do you have for me? If I am able to help in a reasonable amount of time, I will.”

If it is 30 seconds or less, then …

Get a CoS or virtual EA, and forward them each such request for the CoS/EA to create a draft message for you to send. You then hit the Send button.

#### Podcasts

I am so honored by this request. Thank you for thinking of me.

That being said, I unfortunately don’t have space in my schedule to do it.

I am focusing all of my podcast time on setting up and conducting the Mochary CEO Masterminds. These give all Mochary Method CEOs access to the “behind the scenes” info that each of us can only get when the recording devices are turned off.

I love that you are doing your podcast. It does and will create tremendous value. I am cheering you on from the sideline\!

While I can’t do your podcast, there is another [Mochary Method coach](https://mocharymethod.com/#coaches) who can. Would you be open to having one of them on?

Each of them has done at least one (and some several) excellent podcasts. They are stars.

#### Interviews of candidates (that don't get hired)

Often a CEO likes to interview all candidates that are one level below her reports. And Recruiting wants to show at least 3-4 qualified candidates for each open position, which is more to prove that Recruiting is performing than it is about getting better candidates. Offer rates therefore are, by definition, around 25% or less. This strategy leads to many onsite interviews of candidates who never get hired—a tremendous cost. Don't pay it.

Instead, go with the policy of only bringing in an A player for an onsite interview (i.e., only candidates that absolutely blew you away in the first phone screen), and then be willing to hire that person without seeing any other candidates. If you do this, you will be able to move much faster. The best candidates can only be closed if you move very fast because they want to feel that you fell in love with them from the first moment that you met them. (Btw, someone else is moving very fast with them, so if you don't, you will lose them.) If you do this, your acceptance rate on the best candidates will go way up. And you will spend far less time interviewing, leaving far more time for onboarding your phenomenal hires and building the company.

Have your first phone screen scheduled for 15 minutes

In addition, once you make your initial phone screen very strict and only bring A players for onsite interview day, then do what Palantir does: They split the interview day into two halves and inform the candidate of this. They only pass to the second half of the day if the first half went well. At lunch, the team reads the morning interviewers' assessments. If they are positive, the candidate moves to the afternoon to meet the more senior interviewers. If the morning didn't go well enough, the interview day ends at lunch, thus saving a lot of time for the senior exec.

Some CEOs and Department Heads feel that they need to be the bar raiser. And the bar-raising function is indeed essential. But you don't have to be that person. You can train that person. The way to do that is:

- They watch you do 2-3 interviews and see your conclusion.
- You watch them do 1-2 interviews, and you give them feedback on their conclusion. Once you feel satisfied that the person will act as you do, then …
- They take your place as a bar-raiser and teach someone else using the method above.

####

#### 1-1s with former reports

Many CEOs create deep relationships with their reports. As the company grows and they need to layer those reports, the layered person wants to maintain a connection with the CEO and asks to continue their 1-1s. The CEO often agrees. But later, these 1-1 with non-direct reports become burdensome as the opportunity cost of that time becomes higher and higher.

Share this transparently with the non-direct reports. They are owners of the company too. They want to maximize their equity value. Once they realize that their 1-1s with you are taking you away from running the business, they will no longer want the 1-1s.

####

#### Difficult conversations

Many people fear difficult conversations. This emotion is understandable. We were never trained in school to have these conversations. We don't know how to make them go well. Read [Feedback](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wi714sobuQP72sKXw6J_gkwkhtVh1t6--op_Pk0YPxA/edit) and practice (role-play) with a partner until you're able to stick to the script. Then try it on the next difficult conversation. You might end up loving difficult conversations\!

####

#### 1-1s that are not functional

They are your direct reports. You know that you need to have 1-1s with them. But the meetings are draining. What would make it exquisite for you? Write down all the criteria, and then share those criteria with your report at the next 1-1. Ask if they are open to having such a 1-1 going forward. They will say "yes\!"

If you're unsure what a fantastic 1-1 would look like, experiment with this [1-1 Template and Instructions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1j7ZNWTh9ClS0PZHrpZXGk879pv9LXDWt6sjaq1uA-zA/edit).

####

#### Group meetings that are not functional

As the group leader, you have to hold group meetings to keep your team informed, decide on cross-functional issues, and facilitate feedback (peer-to-peer and to you). But that doesn't mean that you need to run the meeting. Pick your most process-oriented team member (or hire a [Chief of Staff](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-tcubUwvktoV-Ou3bB6ynk2LLwNzdT3D_p_ILreyR_A/edit)). Have them be the Meeting Lead. You are still the decision-maker, but they set the agenda, ensure that all attendees get their pre-work submitted before the meeting, keep the time-boxing during the meeting, ensure that issues drive to decisions and then to specific actions with DRIs and due dates, which all get recorded in your Agreements Tracker. If you and they aren't sure what a good meeting looks like, follow the guidance in [Meetings](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sz99Z8qgWNFULiNJhR0w5mtSxipD5XaPXt8aRTvYwDY/edit).
