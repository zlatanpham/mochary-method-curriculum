[Emotions \- name them](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qViPEjTQ7XlkvZAqU1YZQYJtpPqgjvyxPaKXpwbb_L4/edit) (1 min)

We all experience emotions. There is nothing wrong with them. In fact, they are healthy and contain their intelligence.

I posit that there are five basic emotions \-- excitement, joy, fear, anger, and sadness \-- and that all other emotions are simply a shade of these basic ones, just as all colors are some combination of red, yellow, and blue.

**Excitement** is future-looking. We don't know what will occur, but we predict that it will be good.

**Fear** is future-looking. We don't know what will happen, and we predict that it will not be good.

**Joy** is present. What is happening right now is good.

**Anger** is present. What is happening right now is not good.

**Sadness** is the past. What has already happened in the past is not good and is likely unrecoverable. This emotion can be a death of a person or a vision of what could have been.

So, emotions are an alert for us to notice. That is healthy. But when we experience fear or anger, our brain function moves from our pre-frontal cortex (creative thought) to our amygdala (fight or flight response), which is only capable of minimal thought.
