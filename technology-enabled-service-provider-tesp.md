A technology-enabled service provider provides an offline service (shipping, insurance, legal advice, real estate brokerage) but is made more effective and efficient through technology.

In the world of software, where no humans are needed each time a customer uses the product, gross margins are usually over 90%. So investors don't have to worry about the distinction between revenue and gross profit. They are nearly the same. Product Market Fit is then determined by how many customers are willing to pay for the product. Many see $1mm of revenue (for custom code) as a good proxy.

However, in a technology-enabled service provider (TESP), humans are definitely involved each time a customer uses the service. Gross margins are never as high as 90%. And sometimes, they are negative. Investors have been using the $1mm revenue mark as proof of PMF. But that metric is not relevant in a TESP. I can easily garner $1mm of revenue for legal services if I provide $2mm worth of a lawyer's time. And this is what many TESPs have been doing. Rather than building a profitable business, they have focused on what they need to do to raise each further financing round. The answer, until now, has been … growth and custom code.

The further problem is that as each of these TESPs grows, it becomes harder to change the core workflow to make it profitable. All they are doing is building a company that loses more and more money.

Luckily, there is an answer: **Stop growing\!**

Instead, take the users that you currently have (you don't need many) and value-engineer your process over and over again until you have created as much variable margin as possible. Only then is it time to scale.

Because **PMF in a TESP is not $1mm of revenue, instead, it is \>50% variable margin.**

The process to get to \>50% variable margin should be:

- Make the process as efficient as possible using only off-the-shelf technology, then …
- When the process is not changing anymore, write custom code to add the final bits of functionality that the 3rd-party tools cannot.

To do this, you will have to:

- Find a funding partner who agrees with the perspective above
- Raise a lot of money, and then pivot away from growth to efficiency (I don't recommend this, as it is duplicitous)
- Not raise any outside capital

I strongly suggest that you consider the third option.

I have gotten good pushback on this write-up. It goes like this:

"It's important to demonstrate the ability to create attractive unit economics, but there is a legitimate strategy of foregoing high variable margin for high growth, i.e., pricing low to gain market share and dominate the market, and only then raise prices and pull in huge profits. This is Amazon, Uber, DoorDash. When lots of capital is available, this is usually a good strategy."

I agree. The key is first proving that there is attractive unit economics before choosing to forego them. You'd hate to become a $1b revenue company only to find out that you actually can't create positive margin.
