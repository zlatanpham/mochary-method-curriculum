In my coaching, I have found that a key value-add that I can bring is increased transparency and efficiency in the communication between the Board and the CEO.

As Board Members, we want to share our knowledge and network with the founder to help her succeed (and therefore make our investment more valuable). But we don't want to offend or embarrass that founder, so we rarely give our full critical feedback, and certainly not in a board meeting group setting.

As a CEO, we want to get full value (and therefore the full thoughts) from our advisors and board members. But we often forget to ask for full critical feedback specifically, and rarely do we ask for it in writing.

Both the withholding from the board members and not asking for feedback from the founder cause inefficiency in the communication. With this one-time exercise, hopefully, we will eliminate that inefficiency from our collective communication.

The exercise:

1. We schedule 80-minutes together. All board members, the CEO, and Matt.
2. All do the following pre-reads:
   1. This doc (5 min)
   2. [Feedback: Receiving: the 5 A’s](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zsVOnpNayriDpzgjJUDO2n47YxO9EAXbVH2uC_Zpnms/edit) (3 min)
      1. If you want to know even more, you can read [Feedback](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wi714sobuQP72sKXw6J_gkwkhtVh1t6--op_Pk0YPxA/edit) (15 min)
   3. If you are the type of person that likes to do pre-work, please do Steps 3a and 3b before the meeting.
      1. If you run best by acting in the moment, you can do Steps 3a and 3b live in the meeting.
3. During that meeting/call
   1. Each board member creates a private scratchpad for themselves. I recommend a blank Google Doc.
   2. Each board member writes down in that scratchpad what actions the CEO has done that they LIKE, and what steps they WISH THAT the CEO would do (or not do). **\[10 minutes\]**
      1. Please give the rawest WISH THAT feedback that you can think of.
         1. If you write multiple points, please place the most important one to you at the top.
         2. The CEO will unpack only the rawest of this feedback.
         3. Yes, it's a competition\!
      2. During this writing time, the CEO can respond to emails.
   3. All paste their feedback into the shared doc.
   4. Each person reads their LIKEs to the CEO. **\[5 minutes\]**
      1. The intent here is to generate joy and celebrate all the good in this relationship.
   5. Each person reads their top WISH THAT to the CEO **\[5 minutes\]**
      1. We can’t really understand the full message until we read it AND hear it spoken as well.
   6. All read through the remainder of the WISH THAT feedback. **\[5 minutes\]**
      1. Each person adds in comment \+1 to WISH THAT feedback from others that they agree with.
      2. After the CEO completes hearing and reading WISH THAT feedback from a person, he says "Thank you (name of person)" to confirm that he has heard or read their feedback.
   7. The CEO picks the juiciest WISH THAT feedback and fully unpacks it by following this script: [Feedback: Receiving: the 5 A's](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zsVOnpNayriDpzgjJUDO2n47YxO9EAXbVH2uC_Zpnms/edit) **\[10 minutes\]**
      1. Ask
      2. Acknowledge
      3. Appreciate
      4. Accept
      5. Action.
   8. The CEO continues to unpack the other juicy WISH THATs until the meeting time is over or all of the juicy feedback has been processed. **\[50 minutes\]**
      1. If there is enough time, it is ideal to unpack each board member's top issue (so that each feels heard).

All need to recognize that board members are highly qualified to give feedback in some areas (the effectiveness and efficiency of the board meeting, their interaction with the CEO) and less qualified in other areas (how to run the company). It doesn't mean that board members shouldn't give feedback in areas they are not as qualified in; it just means the CEO will be putting that feedback through a more stringent filter to see whether it resonates with him/her.

You may be thinking, "Why is it necessary to have Matt attend this? This seems very simple, and we can do this without Matt." Absolutely, it could be. But there is a reason that we don't give full feedback. We don't know how the recipient (in this case, the CEO) will receive that feedback. There is a chance that she might get very angry, defensive, hurt, etc. and then take the feedback as an attack, not a gift. This response rarely happens, but sometimes it does. And it is why Matt is there.

If this happens, Matt will jump in and help the CEO quickly release their anger and see the feedback for the gift. That is Matt's only role. Think of him as a lion-tamer. Most likely, the lion will stay in the cage, and the CEO will not need Matt. But if he is required, we'll all be glad that he's there.

Notes:

1. I have done this exercise at Confluent, Reddit, Sonder, Mattermost, Viz, etc. And each of those boards and CEOs have found it to be worthwhile. If anything, they've wanted it to be longer.

2. The full version of this exercise takes 80 minutes. We can do a quick-and-dirty version that takes 50 minutes. But the shorter version rarely feels as successful as the full version.

3. If the exercise proves to be helpful for all, then here is the follow-up:
   1. CEO asks for written feedback at the end of every board meeting.
   2. CEO treats all feedback as the gift it is.
   3. After the CEO has read the feedback (can be after the board meeting), she lets the board know what actions she will be taking.
   4. At the beginning of the next board meeting, she lets the board know which of these actions she has completed and the results.
   5. If the board members are open to it, the CEO gives written feedback to each board member in their subsequent interaction (likely 1-1).
