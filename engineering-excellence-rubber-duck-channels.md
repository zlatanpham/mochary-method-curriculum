(These ideas came from Matt Mochary interviewing Aaron White. Aaron is the founder and CEO of Blissfully, which was purchased by Vendr, because Ryan Neu (CEO of Vendr) deemed Blissfully to be the one of the most, if not the most, productive engineering orgs Ryan had ever seen.)

One of the primary tenets of creating excellence in an engineering org is speed. Speed from idea to prototype. Speed from getting stuck on a problem to getting help. Speed from having feedback to give to actually giving that feedback. Speed from realizing that someone doesn’t meet the talent bar to letting them go (with kindness).

By this point, it is a well-accepted tenet that an engineering organization that has true talent density (see [No Rules Rules](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KU0WiVVu2ZiINORMaO0Nyf7eR0isc5NO-Xi7RG6YaNY/edit)) is far more effective than one that doesn’t have it. But how to get there?

One of Aaron’s key tools is the Rubber Duck channel.

Rubber Ducking is a familiar concept to most engineers. If you are struggling to solve a problem, it often helps to say it out loud to someone else. By explaining it, the answer often appears. So much so that you don’t even need to explain it to another person. You can simply put a Rubber Duck on your desk and explain the problem to the duck.

Aaron takes this familiar concept and puts in online … actually on Slack. Each person in the engineering org gets their own “Rubber Duck channel” in Slack. There, they can write out the engineering problems that they face. This often leads to the solution. But if it doesn’t, it also allows the more senior engineers to quickly see when another engineer is stuck and offer helpful suggestions. These channels also allow the whole team to learn from the most senior engineers, to see how they solve problems.

Those who don’t use the channels don’t get immediate help, and therefore often struggle to keep up. Anyone who struggles to keep up receives feedback quickly.

As soon as Aaron has the thought “Hmmm, that person isn’t doing what I would hope they would do.”, Aaron does not wait more than 24 hours before letting the person know, as well as what exactly he hopes they would do (ie- speed to feedback).

Once Aaron gives someone direct feedback, if they don’t fully repair within 2 weeks, Aaron [fires them well](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1J3c8lGMzPJXMMSWNIh7UCsv-_4qKYZkrkwloIbu3BW8/edit).

The channels are so effective that Aaron now tests an engineer’s ability to use the channel during the interview process. Aaron gives the engineer a problem to solve on the spot that he knows the engineer will not have time to solve. Aaron tells them that, and simply asks them to share their thinking out loud as they tussle with the problem. Aaron is not looking for a solution, he is simply looking for their willingness to let their struggling thoughts be known by others.

Once they join the company, he encourages them to start using their Rubber Duck channel instantly, even as they are onboarding. This also gives Aaron valuable feedback on the onboarding process itself so that he can improve it quickly.

If a new engineer does not use the Rubber Duck channel, Aaron gives them feedback within 24 hours that they need to. If they continue to not use the channel, or they continue to struggle in the same way even after getting help, Aaron lets them go quickly. Aaron feels that he knows within 2 weeks whether someone will be a great addition to the team. All that are not, he lets go within days.

This is a radical approach. And it works.
