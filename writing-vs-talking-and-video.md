#### Individual

As your company scales, you will likely be delivering the same message to more and more people. Continuing to do so verbally will not scale.

If you say something twice, write it down (in a Google Doc). From then on, when you want to convey that same message, share a link to the Doc. And then create a company Wiki, and post the link there. That scales.

#### Group

When people discuss an issue, efficiency is essential. When a team discusses an issue, each inefficient minute exponentially increases by the number of people in the discussion.

If you want the most effective and efficient decision-making process, **require that anyone who wants to discuss an issue write it up, along with the desired solution, ahead of time.** This write-up aims to be thorough enough that there are few (or no) questions at the time of decision-meeting. You can achieve this in one of two ways:

1\. The hard way: Write a comprehensive analysis from the get-go.

2\. The easy way: Write a draft, circulate it to the meeting participants before the meeting, and invite comments and questions. Then write out responses to all of these comments and questions before the meeting.

Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon, is famous for using this written method. He requires that anyone who wants to bring up an issue or proposal write up the item entirely before the decision meeting (with someone else writing up a counterproposal if necessary). Then spend the meeting reading the write-ups. Once the decision-making team has read them all, they will make a decision. If the team cannot reach a consensus, an appointed decision-maker makes the call. If there are still open questions, then the decision-maker assigns one or more people to research and, of course, write the needed follow-up. At the end of the next meeting, the participants will make the decision.

Though time-consuming for the sponsor, this method yields extraordinarily thoughtful decisions in a short amount of time. One person's extra effort and work will create net savings in time and energy across the whole group.

Imposing this process on a group is daunting. Here is a way to ease a group into it:

Meeting 1\. Reserve the first 15 minutes of the meeting for all participants to write out their updates and issues. Then use another 10 minutes for all participants to read each other's updates and issues. Then discuss and decide.

Use this method for 2-3 meetings, then...

Meeting 2\. Require that all participants write their updates and issues before the meeting. Do not allow people to bring up an issue that they have not already written up. Use the first 10 minutes of the meeting for all participants to read each other's updates and issues.

Use this method for 1-2 meetings, then…

Meeting 3\. Require that all participants write their updates and issues by a specific time before the meeting (e.g., 9 pm the night before). Require that all participants read and comment on each other's updates and issues before the meeting. People prove that they have read the docs by having their comments in the docs themselves. Do not allow people to make comments in the meeting if they haven't already commented on the docs themselves.

**Note:** It isn't easy to move from Meeting 2 to Meeting 3\. It only works if everybody submits their written updates on time and reads each other’s in the narrow window between submission time and meeting start time. If even one person misses, they will be left out. You have a choice here; you can be militant and get to Meeting 3 or stay put at Meeting 2\. Most companies (including Amazon) have decided that Meeting 2 is the right balance between functionality and enforceability.

#### Video

Talking certainly has its place. Writing is a faster download of fact-based information (content). But to understand the nuance (context, emotion), I need to hear it spoken. The ultimate communication, therefore, is both written and verbal. It starts with a written update/issue (to clarify thinking) and concludes with a short oral presentation (to share the nuance).

To apply this, when reviewing a written issue in a meeting, ask all participants to read the issue and then have the proposer verbally present the issue before others write in their comments.

To make this fully asynchronous, **require that when someone writes up an issue or update, they record a short (\<2 minute) video of themselves describing that same issue/update and send out this video along with the written one issue/update.** That way, viewers can get the entire content and context asynchronously. Respondents can comment asynchronously. And decision-makers can then often make decisions asynchronously. _(This has been magical for my coaching. I am now able to share meaningful advice/reactions before a meeting. Before the meeting, the coachee ingests that content, and the meeting itself becomes a 3x deeper dive than it was previously.)_

**The exception to asynchronous decisions** is if the decision-maker has to clarify the proposer's or commentators' questions. This situation may require several minutes of interactive discussion, which the team can quickly do in the next team meeting.

Another place where video is extremely useful is in recruiting, where you, the founder needs to sell the candidate on the company's vision. Why repeat that process over and over? Simply record yourself once, and share it with candidates in advance of meeting with them. Candidates will not only come to their first meeting with you more enthused about the company, but they will also feel more connected to you because they will feel that this is the "second time" they've met you.
