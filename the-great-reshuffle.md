[The Great Reshuffle](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Xn1CRHz7vN_hx-Ndp50iuDgo4K_THe8cb2yOePZk0Hk/edit) (2 min)

Vaccines are rolling out. And CEOs are declaring their offices to be open. But not everyone is coming back. Many people are very happy working remotely in Nashville, TN or Boise, ID. They have no interest in going back to the office in San Francisco or New York. So what will happen? Will CEOs allow workers to stay remote if they want? Some yes, many no.

The world is about to split. The majority of CEOs will not have the conviction to declare a pure culture. Most will allow department heads or individuals to decide whether they want to be in-person or remote.

But some CEOs will have the conviction to declare a unified culture. Some already have. Coinbase and Brex have declared themselves to be Remote First forever. Others are about to declare themselves In-Person First. And when that happens, the Great Reshuffle will begin.

Those workers who crave an in-person experience (and many do) will leave their Remote First company to join one that is now in-person. Those workers who want to stay remote (and many do) will leave their newly In-Person company for Remote First.

Who exactly will leave first? Those with the most confidence that they can easily find another role with a great company. And who are those? People with confidence don't map 100% to those that are good. But there is a high correlation. So, those who leave early will be those who are generally very good.

There will be a lot of short-term pain while this transition occurs. A lot of institutional knowledge will walk out the door. A lot of time-consuming recruiting and onboarding will have to happen. But there will be a silver lining. In-Person companies will recruit as many great people as they lose. Remote First companies will as well.

And the Hybrid companies will sit on the sideline, breathing a sigh of relief that they aren't experiencing this pain. Until ….

Over the coming years, the stories will come back. People will talk. Those at In-Person companies will enjoy communing with all of their co-workers. Those at Remote First will enjoy being first-class citizens in a unified culture.

Remote workers at Hybrid companies will not. They will feel like second-class citizens as information-sharing and relationship-building will more easily occur between those in the office. The exemplary remote workers will start to leave. And the Hybrid companies will not have gotten the benefit of hiring the best talent during the Great Reshuffle. Hybrid companies will therefore suffer. And eventually, those who are in person at those Hybrid companies will also start to leave. Why? Because their company will not be performing, and their equity value will not be what they want it to be.

The Great Reshuffle is coming. If you are the CEO and plan to go back to the office full-time or stay remote full-time, get ready for both the pain and the pleasure. Once the year ends, you will emerge much stronger.

If you plan on straddling the fence, enjoy the next few years … while they last.
