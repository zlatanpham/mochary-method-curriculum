[Star performers: How to keep them engaged and motivated](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1URb0E9CR2ZeUZ2aTRYcrKb7zbIL0ica8HEYy5CKL3lU/edit) (2 min)

As your company grows, you will experience regrettable attrition. Some people that you value deeply will leave. You will experience sadness and fear. You will ask yourself: What could I have done to keep them? What can I do to keep those that are still here?

You will come up with many ideas. And in my experience, all of them will be good ideas, but none will hit the mark. Why? Because there is no one solution. Each star performer is experiencing a different thing.

So, what to do? Ask.

I ask this question of all my star performers (meaning everyone in my organization, because if they're not a star performer, I help them find a great role elsewhere):

_How are you feeling about your work life, 1-5 (with 3 being "meeting expectation")?_

- _If the answer is a 3 or 4, what would make it a 5?_
- _If the answer is \<3, what would make it a 3?_

I then see if I can make these conditions occur. 80% of the value is in me asking the question and listening to the answer so that my star performer feels heard. 20% of the value is creating the requested condition so that my star performer feels cared for.

I then go further and ask:

_How do you feel about your life overall, 1-5?_

- _If the answer is a 3 or 4, what would make it a 5?_
- _If the answer is \<3, what would make it a 3?_

I ask this because dissatisfaction at home leads to dissatisfaction at work. If I can help my star performer create more peace at home, she/he will bring that peace/joy to work.

This step has been game-changing for my team. We have been able to raise the productivity of some team members 10x by helping them sort out their personal life.

I then go further still and ask:

_If you work remotely, how are you feeling about your Work From Home (WFH) setup, 1-5?_

- _If the answer is a 3 or 4, what would make it a 5?_
- _If the answer is \<3, what would make it a 3?_

_How are we performing as a company, 1-5?_

- _If the answer is a 3 or 4, what would make it a 5?_
- _If the answer is \<3, what would make it a 3?_

_What is it like to work with the rest of the team, 1-5?_

- _If the answer is a 3 or 4, what would make it a 5?_
- _If the answer is \<3, what would make it a 3?_

And finally:

_What is it like to work with me, 1-5?_

- _If the answer is a 3 or 4, what would make it a 5?_
- _If the answer is \<3, what would make it a 3?_

Ask these five questions. Listen to the answers. Pick the category with the lowest rating. Focus on that one for now. See what actions your report and you can take. Do them. Report back to each other on them. See your star performers' feelings of joy and satisfaction rise\!

I find that a good cadence for asking these same questions is monthly. Its enough time for real change to occur. I also find that I do not need to be the one to ask these questions. I am able to pair my reports with each other, who can then support each other in asking these questions. And they of course let me know whenever there is an issue or block that I am causing (or can help solve).

---

While I talk about using this method for star performers, the reality is that all team members benefit from these questions. And if you're not interested in investing the time needed to ask these questions of some of your reports, the question I have for you is, "Why are you still working with those people?"
