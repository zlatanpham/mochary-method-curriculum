[Trust: How to create it among peers](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EKLDirgPz4VYnPe1Z3S7mHc9enkPOPVtKwfBwq05z48/edit) (2 min)

"Matt, I'm able to create trust and like with my reports (or partners) by following your methods, but how do I get my exec team members (or partners) to create trust and like amongst themselves?"

What worked for you will work for them. You just have to guide the exec team to it.

First, please read these docs on how to create trust and like with your reports/partners to make sure that you're following all of the steps:

- [Trust and Like](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BQOa7foLLxNXmGUhbvkzsvm0IVYOJZTFU4MKOmreCXc/edit?usp=drive_web&ouid=102503928790226855337) (5 min)

- [How to maintain personal connection in a remote world](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15bF88nIzZGJT9NTDXK6IR1ZzRCBqYMr8NK_No8nM0aI/edit) (3 min)
- [Appreciation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1id4TBGwDPuCvXiEW8RvJh-ajUuhrBnayoz9D1t1Gj3Y/edit?usp=drive_web&ouid=102503928790226855337) (1 min)
- [Praise](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aXFhFbtIxmUdrUe9y341ghd-EJ89hJZ7g9tOKnw16FI/edit) (2 min)
- [Relationships \- How to create a good one between a Manager and her Reports](https://docs.google.com/document/d/166UMlHgOUnKb4rgLOjFl_etT8kaey2vEFVtwaCAfdDA/edit) (3 min; 60 min for the links)

Next, help your partners or exec team walk through these same motions with each other. Here's how:

- Create a sheet with [Personal Info, Team \- example](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Ti_xaV9IVvj-bklxOjNY-IeGsC-YqcgvB03qvfFQrnI/edit#gid=0) (1 min). Put in your information. Then share it with your team and ask them to do the same.

- Encourage your team members to ask each other about their personal lives using this info. This action allows everyone to get to know each other as humans and feel seen and cared for as a real person, rather than just a work contributor. You can model this in the first few minutes of each team meeting by:

- Asking one or two members about their personal life (yes, in front of everyone else … and rotating who you ask), or

- Asking each person to spend 30 seconds verbally sharing a highlight from their personal life since the group met last.

- Once the team is doing the baby steps above and finding value, share with the team the readings above. Ask each team member to reach out to one another between meetings. You can even require it, as Gitlab does, through its Donuts tool: [Remote: Gitlab's Guide to All-Remote](https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/guide/) (a while to read)

- At an offsite, you can go deeper.

  - Start with light [Icebreakers](https://www.icebreakers.ws/)

  - Then move to deeper exercises, like [Trust, Deep](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IB7YDr_trYKavL_RdWTb8ddJt77eqDH_6H5BsK416FM/edit) (2 min).

    - Please give this work a few hours. It will be scary. Hire someone to facilitate the process if you don't want to do it yourself. But get it done. Once you do, it will forever bond your team.

    - If you do hire a facilitator, they should be in person with you. (I have experimented with facilitating a session where I was remote and the team was in person. It did not work, because the team couldn’t sense the depth of my emotion when I shared my shameful thought.)

- Keep the connection going by implementing a regular practice of peer feedback using this [Feedback Form 1-1](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16iXM6T45R5cxPR_OT3hA8iumqNV9fhjNLphsfSCWo1A/edit) (4 min). The cadence should be at least quarterly, hopefully monthly, and best bi-weekly (rotating the pairs which give each other feedback).

If you follow all of these steps, it will deeply bond your team for the long term.
