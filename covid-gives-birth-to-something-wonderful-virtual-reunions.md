[COVID gives birth to something wonderful: virtual reunions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1U8sOibe0Mgw6rEgIJuRx2nSIrjp_xB3Xml5z2xTwlV8/edit) (1 min)

Gathering family, friends, or work associates together used to be time-expensive. To have a family reunion, someone had to choose a central location, pick a date, purchase plane tickets, reserve hotel rooms, etc.

That has all changed with COVID. These gatherings are no longer possible. So, instead, we are setting up Zoom gatherings â€¦ and realizing that in a 30-minute Zoom call, we get much of the benefit of seeing each other and getting caught up on each other's lives without the massive expense in both time and money to go to an in-person gathering.

With the cost of creating such a gathering being lowered so much (no money, and only 30+ minutes), we can now organize more of these gatherings and connect with more people.

In the last few days, I have set up reunion calls with my extended family, college roommates, high school buddies, and even middle school buddies. Some of these groups haven't gathered together in decades. Now they have, and it was super-satisfying to connect with them.

Why not reach out to those who live far away and that you haven't connected with in years? The cost is low, and the payback is high.

Which then leads to the real question: Why ever go back to the high-cost method of gathering again?
