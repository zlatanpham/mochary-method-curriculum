Beyond Bill Aulet, author of [_Disciplined Entrepreneurship_](https://www.amazon.com/Disciplined-Entrepreneurship-Steps-Successful-Startup/dp/1118692284/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=disciplined+entrepreneurship&qid=1675282439&qu=eyJxc2MiOiIxLjkzIiwicXNhIjoiMS42OSIsInFzcCI6IjEuODcifQ%3D%3D&sprefix=disciplined+en%2Caps%2C184&sr=8-1), there are 3 voices that have massively impacted how I think about Product Development.

- Marty Cagan, author of [_Inspired_](https://www.amazon.com/INSPIRED-Create-Tech-Products-Customers/dp/1119387507)
- Rahul Vohra, CEO of Superhuman
- Wei Deng, CEO of Clipboard Health

**Traditional product development**

Marty Cagan is the current guru of product development. He writes that the old way of doing product development is:

- Talk to a bunch of new or potential customers.
- Understand the top problems they have and identify the commonalities among them.
- For the top common problem that has the least good solution currently in the marketplace, figure out how you can solve it far better than the current next-best solution.
- List the features required, prioritize those features by building the easiest ones with the most impact first, and the hardest ones with the least impact last. This is your Product Roadmap. Go build.

The new way, he writes, is:

- Still talk to new or potential customers, and figure out the top common problem that has the least good solution currently in the marketplace. Then …
- Build a prototype of your solution and get it into real users hands in a matter of days.
  - Don’t waste time designing the solution. Instead, slap together a quick and dirty prototype and get it in the hands of users for their reactions.
  - User feedback is far more valuable than design. So, skip design and get to user feedback as fast as you can.
- And then create another prototype and get into real users hands in another few days.
- Keep iterating like this until users are loving the prototype. Then build that\!

**Superhuman innovation**

Superhuman went through this process and got real users. Some loved his early prototype, others thought it was OK.

Rahul Vohra, CEO, interviewed all of their users and found that Superhuman was solving different problems for different users. Better solutions were available for the people who didn't love the product. However, the people who _loved_ Superhuman had a problem for which Superhuman was the only solution.

So which feedback should he listen to when creating the next version? Rahul’s first instinct was to win over those who didn’t yet love the prototype, since their feedback was harsher. But then it dawned on him …

“Rather than try to dumb this product down into something that's generic like everything else, why don't I just focus on the people who have a problem that only I can solve and then go find many more people with that same problem?”

And that’s exactly what he did. He documented his thinking in [this article](https://review.firstround.com/how-superhuman-built-an-engine-to-find-product-market-fit).

That's the first innovation: Talk to your users to figure out all the problems your users have, but really focus on solving the problem for which there is no other good solution. Focus on your users who couldn’t make it without your product.

**Prototyping**

Prototyping tools have become extraordinarily good. Figma, many different no code tools, prototyping in custom code (as long as there is a sandbox where the code doesn’t need to be stable) are all excellent options. The key is to create a prototyping space that isn’t connected to your production site, so that the team building your main product doesn’t require the code to be stable before releasing it to the world. Only then will you be able to build prototypes as fast as they want to be built.

“Well, how separate is separate enough for the prototyping space?”

**Driving innovation via separate incorporated entities**

Wei Deng, CEO of Clipboard Health, has pushed the separation more than anyone else I know when [developing a new product in a scaled company](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oIafvO9RHwstSFimEnKOPEgNVEst7QVrln46EklQc4Y/edit). She feels that having a beta site that is not gated, that is not beholden to production, is not separate enough. For features for an existing product, that may work.

But when she’s building an entirely new product, she wants a separate reporting line for the new product team. She doesn’t want them to report to the VP Eng or VP Product for the primary product. Why? Because there is overhead in being part of a large team:

- The time and headspace it takes to participate in meetings with the manager and the rest of the larger team.
- The design influence of the existing product designer.
- The need for code to be stable and secure before being released to existing customers.

All of these things slow down speed to prototype. And Wei doesn’t want to burden her new product teams with any of it. So, for any new product team, she …

- Creates a new product team that reports directly to her.
- Creates a new corporate entity (which is easy to do), that is 100% owned by Clipboard Health, that owns and operates that new product team.
  - The separate company doesn't really add anything functional but it adds great symbolism in that it proves to the team that they really are not beholden to anyone in the existing infrastructure, in the existing tool, in the existing company.
  - The team feels like they're a true YC start-up with three to five members per team, someone who's designated as the CEO, and they have their own entity (bank account, etc).
- Creates a second new product team that is trying to solve the same problem, to maximize the amount of innovative problem-solving.
  - Microsoft did the same thing, and quickly realized that if one team “won” and created the product that was eventually used, and the other team was not rewarded, then people became reluctant to join any future product team for fear of being on the losing team. (It turns out fear of losing is stronger than joy from winning.)
  - So MSFT, and Wei, now reward both teams for their effort, not the result.

So, for every new product that Wei wants to build, she is creating a separate entity and at least two separate teams trying to identify and solve the problem.
