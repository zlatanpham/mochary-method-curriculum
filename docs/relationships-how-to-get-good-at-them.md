We all want to be good at relationships. Whether we are a CEO, a Manager, or an Individual Contributor, how well we interact with our teammates, customers and investors determine how much positive impact we have. So how do we learn to get good at relationships?

For the answer, I turn to surfing. Learning to surf is hard. Catching a wave is very infrequent, so beginners get a minimal chance to practice on a real wave. Good instructors, therefore, have figured out how to get their students lots of practice on the pieces of surfing that don't require an actual wave.

There are four parts to surfing: paddling, turning, popping up, and riding. It turns out that you can practice the first three without a wave. So, that's what good instructors do. They have their students practice paddling and turning in flat water and practice popping up on land. Once the student masters those skills, they move to a wave. And, not surprisingly, the student then quickly masters catching and riding the wave.

The same pattern holds for relationships. We don't get that many touchpoints with our teammates, customers, and investors. In turn, it means that each of those touchpoints is high stakes, so we find it difficult to experiment with a new way. We need a method of getting lots of practice doing relationships (touchpoints) in a low-stakes way. Where can we get that?

Do you have children, a significant other, a friend, or a parent? The answer, of course, is yes. Well, then, there is your practice ground. Relationships with humans (teammates, customers, or investors) are no different than relationships with humans (children, spouse, friends, or family members). Get good at your relationship with your spouse or children, and you will discover that you learn all the skills needed to develop a great relationship with your teammates or customers.

If you choose to practice with your spouse, you can:

- Ask your spouse if he is interested in learning this with you. (He will say "Yes\!")
- Go on Amazon and choose a book to read and study together (get two copies). Here are some excellent options:
  - [Hold Me Tight](https://smile.amazon.com/Hold-Me-Tight-Successful-Relationships/dp/0749955481/ref=sr_1_2?crid=1H9UY55TRBJ57&dchild=1&keywords=hold+me+tight&qid=1588985984&s=books&sprefix=hold+me+tight%2Cstripbooks%2C296&sr=1-2)
  - [Communication Miracles for Couples](https://smile.amazon.com/Communication-Miracles-Couples-Effective-Conflict/dp/1573245836/?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_w=xgPEh&content-id=amzn1.sym.14ae7937-f413-4d1b-becd-7ba9e97b0c31&pf_rd_p=14ae7937-f413-4d1b-becd-7ba9e97b0c31&pf_rd_r=NQEYABJVBVTZXQDAVDDZ&pd_rd_wg=DtCCH&pd_rd_r=9de1a9f3-821d-43ee-8dcb-078805321575&ref_=pd_gw_ci_mcx_mr_hp_atf_m&pldnSite=1)
- Take a course. Either in a group over a weekend or 1-1 with the teacher.

Who knew that the best way to learn an essential work skill is first to learn that skill at home?\!
