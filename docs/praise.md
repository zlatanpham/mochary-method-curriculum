Motivation is a tricky thing. If you're a CEO or Manager, how do you create it in your team members? How do you maintain it?

Luckily, most people arrive in a job or a relationship with lots of motivation. So, your only job is to help them maintain it.

[Jordan Petersen observes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VM1UA0pCMQ) that if someone does something willfully or intentionally to break the rules or not meet the standards of performance, and you call them out on it, they almost feel relief. They know that they didn't perform, and it's almost comforting to know that you noticed. You haven't hurt the person.

By contrast, if you want to hurt somebody, find someone earnestly trying and chastise them for something they didn't do as you wanted. You will crush them.

Now, of course, none of us wants to hurt anybody nor crush their motivation. The key then is to realize that nearly EVERYONE around us is trying. Our team members, our spouse, our kids, our parents, and our siblings. Nearly EVERYONE.

Treat them as such.

Right now, you are likely thinking: "So, how do I get them to do what I want if I can't point out what they're doing wrong?"

Do the inverse. Point out what they are doing right\!\!\! Thank them for it. "Thank you for doing …." Describe a specific action that they did, not a general personality trait.

Good:

- "Thank you for sending out all the board materials one week before the board meeting."
- "Thank you for doing the dishes last night."

Not good:

- "Thank you for being so conscientious."
- "Thank you for being so helpful."

It may seem simple. But it's potent.

Every time you notice them doing something right, point it out. They will glow with satisfaction that you noticed what they did and that they are trying. Then they will be eager to do even more that is positive. They may even ask you what else they can do. But even if they don't, they will continue to do that one thing that you praised.

As time goes on, notice and praise other things. You are giving them confidence and motivation. Very quickly, you will see their overall performance improve.

And note that these praisings do not have to be lengthy nor in person. You can send a text. It often takes less than one minute to write. You can even make this a regular habit: once a week, or even once a day.

At some point, maybe after 4-8 interactions of praise, they will build a sense of trust that you genuinely appreciate them and want to be in a lasting relationship with them. Once that happens, you have the leeway to point out things that you wish they would do differently (which is best done synchronously, not via text). But never forget to continue to praise as well.

I encourage you to experiment with this at home first. Try it with a child or spouse. I predict that you will experience magic.
