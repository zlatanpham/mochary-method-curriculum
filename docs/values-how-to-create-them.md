[Values](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dyIXkhBrJVwNQZS_CAPxIESNY9hM9rXeb34nZvaiNfE/edit#) (1 min)

There are many ways to create your company values.

A simple one is to complete the following sentence: "The rest of you in the company can make all of the decisions from now on, as long as you …." This is appropriate when the company is small, and values are entirely aspirational.

Another version is to acknowledge the culture that you already have. To do this, each Leadership Team member should pick one person in the company who is NOT on the Leadership Team and exhibits a value that you wish would be a universal behavior. Name the person and the behavior. Then select 3-5 such examples. This method is best used when the company already has a sizeable team and existing culture.
