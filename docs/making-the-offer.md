### [Making the Offer](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IDbshCFwd19_6Ke__-0klE-BYJdJympMMprybTIp1bg/edit) (1 min)

If you make a written offer to a candidate that you love, hoping that they will accept, they may well do so. But they will also be tempted to ask for a few more things before accepting (signing bonus, moving expenses, etc.). You will then be in the awkward position of either giving these (and thereby allowing a political culture to begin) or starting the relationship on a negative note by saying no.

To keep the offer and acceptance process entirely positive, do the following:

Once you have the offer prepared, contact the candidate and ask them to complete the following phrase:

**"I will join the company as long as …."**

They will (hopefully) state all of their requirements. If you are willing to provide each of these, you will have a successful hire. If there is one that you cannot provide, discuss it with the candidate to see if there is some alternative that you both can accept.

Once this process is complete, then ask the candidate:

**"If we were to make you the following offer (state the offer in full detail, including cash, equity, benefits, etc.), would you accept?"**

If they say yes, then invite them in to make the offer in person. The granting and accepting of a job offer is a very emotional moment for a person. Making a big deal out of it is a good thing. I recommend that you make a ceremony out of it. Here are some possibilities:

- Hand the written offer to the candidate with two hands and a ceremonial bow.
- Give company swag.
- Give hugs and high-fives.

Whatever you do, make it fun and memorable. If you do this, the relationship will begin with a resoundingly positive "Yes\! Thank you\! I'm so excited\!"

**Note:** Senior execs will always require that their attorney review the offer before they accept. That is fine. In advance of making the offer, you can share the language of the contract and all the details except for the compensation (income and equity).
