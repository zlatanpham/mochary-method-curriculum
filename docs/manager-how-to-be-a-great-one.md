[Manager: How to be a great one\!](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-_LkABTtV1bmZ287NtinvFhr74Yl3DXzDYdG_zff2qc/edit) (1 min)

What is the goal of a manager? To make your team maximally productive.

How then do you make your team maximally productive?

The primary thing is to create an environment that allows for maximum productivity. To me, this means that each person is:

- Feeling joy in their work life.
- Feeling joy in their personal life. I know this seems beyond the scope of a manager from work. It is not.
- Feeling joy about how the company operates.
- Feeling joy about their interaction with their manager (you\!).
- Feely joy about their interaction with other team members.

The easiest way to help people achieve this joy is to ask them where they are (I like to use a number scale from 1-5) and then ask them what a 5 would look like. For more detail, see the "magic questions" in [Motivating your team](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14kFZcqm3zaS5uY4QmG307BViQyoSbDDS1U04NpYhmes/edit) (2 min).

To get real answers, you'll first have to create trust. The easiest way that I know to do that is to

- Show that you care about who they are as a person. Do this by asking about the things that matter to them in their personal lives, and then remember what they said and ask them about it in future conversations. Keep doing this for several minutes at the beginning of each meeting (whether 1-1 or group).

- Show that you recognize the good work that they are doing. Do this by pointing out the things they have done that you like.
  - If you don't know what they are doing, don't worry. Simply ask them: "What are the things that you have done since our last meeting that you are proud of?" And then praise the person for those things.

Once you have created the trust and are getting honest answers to the Magic Questions, you will be able to help them create a near 10\. Then you can look at their work and see if they are actually applying the needed time to be maximally productive (the quantity of time they are applying is near a 5).

To create and maintain the information flow needed, you should do both regular 1-1s and team meetings. The 1-1s should be prepared for the team meeting so that the team meeting is maximally effective.

These meetings should start with a weekly cadence to build rapport and create norms around communicating. But once you start showing up to meetings, and there is not enough new content to talk about, then it's time to drop the cadence to bi-weekly. This feels like the best cadence for ongoing 1-1s and team meetings. For those people who work exceptionally well without guidance, you can drop the 1-1s to monthly.

And that's it.
