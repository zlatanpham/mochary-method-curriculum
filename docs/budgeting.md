"Financial planning is a huge pain right now. We have raised a lot of money, but we just seem to burn more money, and a lot of people are coming to the well asking for even more resources. The big issue is that I don't feel like we have any infrastructure in place to measure the ROI of the marginal investments that we make. All of the execs want to be investing a lot, and I want to be more measured, and I feel like I'm an army of one pushing for more thoughtfulness."

Sound familiar? If yes, you are not alone. And there are answers.

One effective method is market-based budgeting, where market is determined by looking at the P\&Ls of comparable public companies. Once you have the % of revenue that the comparables spend in each department, then you follow these steps:

- Project revenue for the coming year.

- Go to Sales and ask what resources they need to achieve that revenue. If it falls within the comparable %s, they get it.

- Then go to Product and Engineering and ask what are the critical resources they need to build the key features on the Product Roadmap that will enable the projected revenue. If it falls within the comparable %s, they get it.

- For the remaining departments, they are given a $ number based on the comparables. (Brian Long of Attentive Mobile calls each of these budgets an “envelope”.)

- The envelope should be an amount of $, not headcount. If headcount, then managers will simply hire the most expensive people.

Another method that Amazon has effectively used is the investment (outcomes-based) model. If people want an allocation of $, they must pitch for it, just as a founder would pitch an investment firm. The pitch must include projections of what results can be produced with the dollars. If the decision-maker is compelled, she will allocate the capital. But then there is a cadence of reporting (usually monthly check-ins) wherein the recipient of the capital must report on their progress (OKRs) and metrics (KPIs). Borrowing from the Bridgewater Associates model, people get scored on their ability to deliver their projected ROI. Those with higher scores get further access to capital.

It is essential to do so in dollars when making allocations, not headcount, even though the dollars are primarily used for headcount. Why? Because if you use headcount, then managers will simply hire the most expensive people. If their allocation is in dollars, however, they will optimize for output.

There are, however, several problems with the outcomes-based system. Here are two:

- When the outcomes don’t materialize, department heads begin to blame others in the org, because there is always some kind of dependency. And it is difficult to hold department heads accountable, because the only meaningful consequence is letting them go, and that is often beyond what you want to do (and they know it).

- It takes several iterations (and each iteration is a year if budgeting is annual) to get a meaningful score on a department head.
