[Coach: hire one for the executive team](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fA4Mlf95VePjFWX6wVOtCEKqoNLCFnWpr43yfJDizUg/edit) (1 min)

The book Trillion Dollar Coach describes the role that Bill Campbell played at Google. He was a shadow manager to the exec team. Bi-weekly, he met 1-1 with each exec team member, where they each shared with him their true frustrations. He then attended the weekly exec team meeting and made sure that all of the deepest, darkest issues that people had shared with him surfaced just as transparently to the group, forcing them to deal with them and find a resolution.

This is an incredibly valuable role. As CEO, you can play this role if you enjoy it. But if you don't, then hire someone to do it. This can be a coach or your Chief of Staff. It's not a complicated role to play. It just requires being willing to **ask probing questions and fearlessness to surface the juiciest topic (the "elephant in the room") in the group meeting.**

Chris Mansi of Viz.ai hired a coach to do this and had a great experience. Because of that, I now recommend it to all CEOs that I coach.

Chris Mansi of Viz.ai:

_I definitely recommend having a coach for the entire exec team \- the same person coaching them as a team and 1:1. We used the conscious leadership group, and it's been amazing._

_Benefits are_

_\- you develop a shared language that you can use to move faster without getting in your way_

_\- more trust and transparency, esp at times of stress when it could be easy to "be professional" and not discuss an issue_

_\- exec team feel cared for and invested in_

It will likely work so well at the exec team level that you will want to hire such a person for each big team. Shopify, apparently, has ten full-time internal coaches.
