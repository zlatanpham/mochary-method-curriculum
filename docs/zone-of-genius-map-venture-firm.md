As a venture firm, you can choose to make investing a solo sport (like golf) and have each investor be responsible for all aspects of the investment process on the deals they source, judge, win, and support. Or you turn to invest into a team sport (like soccer) by identifying each investors' unique strengths, mapping those strengths to the investment process, and then asking each investor to perform their skill during that phase of each deal.

If you choose the latter, this exercise will help you do it.

1. Ask all team members to write out the following:
   1. "The different actions that need to occur to make a successful investment are …."
      1. Please include, at least, the following:
         1. Find out about investment opportunities (source)
         2. Decide on those opportunities (judge)
         3. Get chosen to invest in those opportunities (win)
         4. Create value in the company and a trusted relationship with the operator (support)
   2. For each other team member, write:
      1. "Name
         1. You are particularly good at ...
         2. I noticed this in the following example …."
2. Share answers to 1a, merge them and create one process that all can commit to (even if they don't entirely agree with).
3. Share answers to 1b, combine all the perceived strengths of each person in one list. Map them against each step of the investment process in 2\. Mark each name in green.
4. Mentoring: It is also valuable to gain experience in each step of the investment process, even those you aren't already great at. This creates better hand-offs. It also gives you the chance to discover that you might actually love a part of the process that you don't do today. To gain this experience:
   1. Each person declares what part of the process they want to experiment with and from whom they want to learn.
   2. If their target is willing, create a mentor relationship between them (marking the mentee's name in orange on the investment process).

You can also go outside the firm to source feedback by doing the [Zone of Genius](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11UVWJox31Ani8Cq6Ymhm6DiVUiv5vPkOQd8ZdGpYmbs/edit) exercise.
