[Liquidity Programs for the Company](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1z6S84UmEuggKiXVwjb00Qz633gda-6skwOS2T7iFvas/edit) (3 min)

Late-stage private companies are increasingly doing secondary liquidity programs to attract and retain employees and relieve pressure to go public prematurely.

Here are your levers as the CEO:

1\) You decide when to do the program.

- Companies typically do these programs shortly following a primary round when a new preferred price has been set. That timing is advantageous because sellers can be more confident in the price they're being offered for their common shares.

2\) You set the eligibility rules for participation.

- Is the program only open to employees and founders? Or, can early investors and former employees also participate?
- What portion of vested equity are employees eligible to sell? (20% is the median)
- What is the minimum tenure (one year is the median)

3\) You determine the size of the secondary.

- Consider the eligibility rules and take an informal poll of the largest potential sellers to gauge potential interest. The median size of a secondary is \~20%-30% of the size of the recent primary round.

4\) You decide whether to structure the program as a company buyback or a third-party tender offer.

- Third-party tender offer:
  - Can affect the 409a valuation. The median weighting is \~10% per a recent conversation with Andersen Tax, the largest valuation firm. E.g., if the secondary purchase price is $10/sh. and the baseline 409a is $6/sh. then the 409a will increase by $0.40/sh. to $6.40/sh.
- Company Buyback:
  - Will not harm 409a valuation.
  - But, it's less advantageous from a cash perspective because the difference between the secondary purchase price and the 409a is taxed as compensation:
    - The employee pays ordinary income tax.
    - The employee pays payroll tax.
    - The company pays payroll tax.
    - The company recognizes compensation expenses on its income statement.
- For this reason, there has been a general trend towards third-party tender offers in recent years (see NPM 2018 summary analysis).

5\) You decide whether to raise the secondary round from existing investors or to run a process involving new investors for optimal price discovery:

- Option 1: Let existing investors do the secondary:

- There are about a dozen firms in Silicon Valley whose business model is to get onto the cap table, get cozy with management, and then try to get a 10%-30% discount to market value on secondary shares. Notable names are Tiger, Coatue, Glynn, Industry, Akkadian, 137, Dragoneer, Greenspring, Founders Circle.

- Your current Board members can also be persuasive if their firm wants to buy the secondary shares to increase its stake in your company. You answer to them. So, it can be tough to turn down their pitch which is:

  - Avoid the hassle of running a secondary process.
    - Leave it within the family. Don't go to new investors.
    - So, take our offer to do it at a \[10%-30%\] discount

- Option 2: Run a competitive process to raise the secondary:

- Several companies do this: Nasdaq Private Market, Carta, and Solium. Each charges a 2%-4% fee which pays for itself several times over with the more effective price discovery. The sellers only pay this fee if they decide to tender. The company pays nothing.

  - My favorite agent is Nasdaq. They've been doing it the longest and have the most experienced operational team. They've managed \>250 private company secondary liquidity programs to quote numbers, which have provided \> $20 billion of liquidity to \> 30,000 individual employees, founders, and investors.

- You can exclude any investors you don't want in the process upfront.

- There's minimal incremental effort by the company. The data room is already prepared. There may be a few \~60-minute meetings with investors who have expressed a formal indication of interest.

- The agent runs a competitive auction for optimal price discovery. You can also invite existing investors to participate. The same fair rules apply to all parties.

- The agent will do an employee town hall to explain how they achieved a competitive pricing process. On the contrary, employees can be skeptical if a company must explain that a pricing deal was struck privately with a company insider.

You can get significant input on this from your outside counsel. They will have seen many of these programs.

A company within my portfolio recently did a secondary tender offer using NPM. I asked the CEO for his reaction to the NPM service. His response:

"We found it to be a cautious OK. It was a fair amount of work to use, and the interface is quite clunky. Apparently Carta is working on a competitive product, which our team is excited to use if / when we do it again."
