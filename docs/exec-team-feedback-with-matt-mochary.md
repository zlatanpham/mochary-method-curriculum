### Instructions

In my coaching, I have found that a key value-add that I can bring is increased transparency and efficiency in the communication between the CEO and Exec Team and between Exec Team peers.

As members of the Exec Team, we want to share our experience and observations with the CEO and our peers to help each succeed (and therefore make our collective equity more valuable). But we don't want to offend or embarrass those people (imagine the pain of creating an enemy out of any one of them\!), so we rarely give our full critical Feedback, and certainly not in the group setting of an Exec Team meeting.

As a CEO, we want to get full value (and therefore the full thoughts) from our incredibly knowledgeable Exec Team. But we often forget to ask for this specifically, and rarely do we ask for it in writing.

Both the Executive Team's withholding and not asking for Feedback from the CEO cause inefficiency in the communication. With this one-time exercise, hopefully, we will eliminate that inefficiency from our collective communication.

The exercise:

1. We schedule 2 hours (actually 1 hour and 50 minutes) together. All Exec Team members, the CEO, and Matt.

   1. **When you schedule the meeting, please email-connect Matt to all the participants to ensure that they do all the pre-work below.**

2. All attendees do this pre-work:
   1. **Read this doc (3 min)**
   2. **Read [Feedback: Receiving: the 5 A’s](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zsVOnpNayriDpzgjJUDO2n47YxO9EAXbVH2uC_Zpnms/edit) (3 min)**
      1. Optional. If you want more detail, you can read [Feedback](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wi714sobuQP72sKXw6J_gkwkhtVh1t6--op_Pk0YPxA/edit) (15 min)
   3. **Write down (in a private note that only you have access to so that your writings do not influence others):**
      1. **1-5.**
         1. How is the CEO performing 1-5?
            1. 3 is “meeting expectations”
            2. 5 is “she couldn’t be any better”
            3. 1 is “she couldn’t be any worse”
      2. **LIKE.**
         1. What actions the CEO has done that you like? Please …
            1. Give a clear example (ie- “On March 22, you did the following …”
            2. Write only one LIKE. The CEO just needs to see/hear that you see some value in them. But anything more than one LIKE is overkill.
      3. **WHAT WOULD GET THEM TO THE NEXT LEVEL.**
         1. What actions the CEO would need to take to get to the next level of performance (1-5). Please …
            1. Give the rawest WHAT WOULD GET THEM TO THE NEXT LEVEL Feedback that you can think of. The CEO will unpack only the rawest. Yes, it's a competition\!
            2. Focus your Feedback on the behaviors of the CEO, not company issues. (Company issues are a different exercise.)
            3. Write specific actions that you want the CEO to do. Please be very specific.
               1. Good:
                  1. _When you feel anger, take a deep breath and say calmly “I feel anger and therefore am not thinking well now. I’m going to take a break to allow myself to calm down, and then I’ll come back and resume once I’m calm.”_
               2. Not good:
                  1. _Don’t act in anger._
            4. Write only one set of NEXT LEVEL feedback. The CEO will not have time to read more than one set from each person. So please pick the single most important and impactful piece of feedback.
3. During our meeting/call
   1. Brief introduction of the purpose of the meeting. **\[2 minutes\]**
   2. Matt creates a shared Doc. All paste their Feedback into that doc. **\[2 minutes\]**
   3. Each person reads their LIKEs to the CEO. **\[6 minutes\]**
      1. The intent here is to generate joy and celebrate all the good in this relationship.
   4. All read through all of the WHAT WOULD GET THEM TO THE NEXT LEVEL Feedback. **\[10 minutes\]**
      1. Each person adds in comment \+1 to WHAT WOULD GET THEM TO THE NEXT LEVEL Feedback from others that they agree with.
   5. CEO picks the single juiciest and most popular Feedback, and fully unpacks it. **\[20 minutes\]**
      1. CEO asks the author to state the feedback verbally so that the CEO can fully understand it.
      2. CEO thanks the author for being willing to share this information. It took bravery.
      3. CEO summarizes what she thinks she read and asks, "Is that right?"
         1. If the CEO wants to go to the advanced level, she will summarize what the person is really thinking (with swear words\!) and feeling, as that is usually much bigger than what they are willing to write/say. Example:
            1. What was written:
               1. _When you feel anger, take a deep breath and say calmly “I feel anger and therefore am not thinking well now. I’m going to take a break to allow myself to calm down, and then I’ll come back and resume once I’m calm.”_
            2. What is likely in their head:
               1. _Goddammit, why do you always have to be such an f-ing bully? Let people talk and at least have the courtesy to not rage at the ones telling you what you need to hear while the others cower in silence\!_
         2. If the author says "No," the author restates, and the CEO tries to summarize again. Repeat until the author says "Yes."
         3. Once the author says "Yes," then the CEO asks, "Is there more?"
         4. Once the author says, "No, that's it," the CEO asks, "Do you feel heard?"
         5. Once the author says "Yes," then ...
      4. CEO declares whether or not she accepts the Feedback.
         1. There is no requirement to accept. She only does so if the Feedback resonates with her.
   6. If the CEO accepts the Feedback, all team members do a [Brainstorming: written](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zHmVPz0gVQqXctk5w2oKs8cQTLw6uprbPgQZaoO3HT0/edit#heading=h.nlpvf7hfrw7x) for 3 minutes to list what actions the CEO could take to enact the feedback. **\[10 minutes\]**
      1. The CEO reviews all the actions, and declares which ones she accepts.
      2. When declaring an action, it is critical to **write** down:
         1. What the action is
         2. The date by which it will be done
         3. Who will do it
   7. If the CEO does not accept the Feedback, she shares with the author what is going on in the CEO's world to show why she does not accept the Feedback. **\[5 minutes\]**
      1. "Here is what is going on for me. (Then explain all that is happening.) Given that, how can I accept this Feedback?"
      2. The CEO's description should be so thorough that it becomes clear to the author why the Feedback isn't actionable.
   8. The CEO continues to unpack the other juicy WHAT WOULD GET THEM TO THE NEXT LEVEL feedback from other authors (ideally unpacking one from each author) until the meeting time is over, or the CEO processes all of the juicy Feedback. **\[50 minutes\]**
   9. Wrap up. Appreciate one other person in the group for something they did during the meeting. **\[5 minutes\]**
   10. Give written Feedback to Matt about the meeting itself **\[5 minutes\]**

"Why is it necessary to have Matt attend this? This seems very simple, and we can do this without Matt."

- Absolutely, it could be. But there is a reason that we don't give full Feedback. We don't know how the recipient (in this case, the CEO) will receive that Feedback. There is a chance that she might get very angry, defensive, hurt, etc. and then take the Feedback as an attack, not a gift. This reaction rarely happens, but sometimes it does. And that is why Matt is there.
- If this happens, Matt will jump in and help the CEO quickly release her anger and see the Feedback for the gift. That is Matt's only role. Think of him as a lion-tamer. Most likely, the lion will stay in the cage, and the CEO will not need Matt. But if Matt is required, we'll all be glad that he's there.

Notes:

1. I have done this exercise at Plaid, Coinbase, Brex, Sonder, Attentive, etc. Each of those exec teams and CEOs has found it to be worthwhile.
2. The full version of this exercise takes 110 minutes. We can do a quick-and-dirty version that takes 50-80 minutes. But the shorter version rarely feels as successful as the full version.
3. If the exercise proves to be helpful for all, then there is a follow-up:
   1. CEO asks for Feedback in all 1-1s and Team Meetings going forward:
      1. CEO asks for written Feedback at the end of every Exec Team meeting or 1-1.
      2. CEO treats all Feedback as the gift it is.
      3. After the CEO has read the Feedback (can be after the team meeting), she lets the team know what actions she will take against that Feedback.
      4. At the beginning of the next team meeting, she lets the team know which of these actions he has completed and the results.
4. Peers give each other Feedback in the Team Meeting.
   1. After several successful cycles of giving the CEO feedback, ask the Exec Team if they would be open to providing Feedback and receiving Feedback to and from each other in the group. If yes from all, add this to the next team meeting. Start with pairs. Rotate to a new pair each meeting.
   2. Do it in writing. Either:
   3. Each pair creates a shared doc that they use, following the same format above. Or
   4. Create a group shared doc, and each pair puts their Feedback in the group doc.
      1. _This requires pre-approval by every team member to view all Feedback as a gift and not feel shame if they receive brutal Feedback in this group setting. Be skeptical. Many will say yes when they mean no._
