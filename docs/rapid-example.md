**Issue:** People who are at the Bench need unbroken time each day to suit up and do experiments from start to finish. In addition, travelling to SF during commuting hours can turn a 1 hour trip into a 3 hour trip. Social events that are scheduled at 5pm require those from the Bench to depart Sunnyvale at 2pm, and lose an enormous amount of productivity.

**Proposed solution:**  
Social events to be scheduled at 8pm, until we are together in January.

**Comments:**  
Katja: I would be fine with it as long as we have a yoga studio close by where I can go to in between work and social event :) Also, I like Erik’s compromise with starting at 6:30pm.

Raj: :) I am ok with later. 8pm seems ok if it helps the experimental team. Also 6:30 is good.

Erik: I prefer the later time but open to something in between (e.g. 6:30pm?).

Marlo: 8pm seems a little late for employees with families, would we be able to move this time up to maybe 6\. I also like the idea of moving team events to the same day as the team meetings.

Katherine: I live in the city so I’m ok with 8pm. 6:30 works too. If monthly cadence is adopted for moving Thursday meeting to the afternoon, prefer 1st Thursday so it’s easy to remember. I also like Thursday meetings being in the morning so that I can get forkable lunch and socialize with the rest of the company I don’t see on a daily basis.

Steve: I am ok with either 8 or 5\. 6:30 works for me.

Fernando: People who have kids, etc. might not be able to go. The social event will be biased and could negatively impact activities such as recruiting. Suggest polling beforehand to find the best time for the most people. 6:30 is not much better than 5PM. It could be worse coming from the South Bay due to traffic.

Bob: sounds like a good idea, commuting is a big issue; however, moving it away from the work day may result in less attendance by people with family (especially kids). 6:30 would be good.

## Shannon: I also live in the city so I’m okay with any time. 6:30pm seems good. Or a weekend? Or combining with all-hands meetings.

Irene:  
Schedule socials in a more central location (although that may be in SF) at a time that works best for everyone. If an earlier time is preferred, then the team events should be planned with enough time in advance (more than 1 week’s notice) such that studies can be planned accordingly. Having kids, an evening out where I arrive home after 9 is same difference as an evening out starting at 5p or 8p.

Victor:  
No. I usually go to bed early. I also feel this idea could be bad for team members with kids and other family responsibilities.

A proposed solution is to keep after-hours events earlier (such as 5pm), but schedule them only on days where the entire team is already at HQ (see Calendar Cadence).

I agree and think 6-7:30pm is a good idea. Other ideas:

1. Make sure people who are in SF and have families are OK with this.
2. Schedule events far enough in advance to accommodate.
3. (Stealing Matt’s idea) \- combine social events with days when they will be in office meeting.
4. Schedule social events on a regular cadence (i.e. every third Thursday) would also help people plan around them.

Decision:

- **More than 1 week’s notice to be given on all social events. (Marlo).**
- **Schedule the social event on the day bench scientists will be in the office (ie. Thursdays) (Marlo).**
- **If needed 6:30p (that require travel), if already in HQ, then start at 5p. (Marlo).**
- **Monthly cadence for socials, once monthly Experimental Thursday team meeting will be moved to the afternoon followed by social to start at 5p. (Marlo).**
- **Marlo and Irene will meet to schedule the upcoming socials for the rest of the year (Irene)**
