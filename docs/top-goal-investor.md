## [Top Goal (investors)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1u1zhHYoBRfScvQ5jx9FqDQX9TKLgUCS6EgNa2Emmiaw/edit?usp=sharing)

Greg McKeown wrote a phenomenal book on productivity called [Essentialism](https://smile.amazon.com/Essentialism-Disciplined-Pursuit-Greg-McKeown/dp/0804137382/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1479153913&sr=8-1&keywords=essentialism). Here is a good [summary](https://paulminors.com/essentialism-by-greg-mckeown-book-summary-pdf/). When I spoke to the author, he boiled it down to one key concept: Schedule 30 minutes each day to work on your Top Goal only. And do that every single workday. Period.

Specifically:

1. Block off 30 minutes each day on your calendar to work on your Top Goal. The earlier in the day, the better, as there is less chance that other pressing issues will interfere.

2. When you get to this moment in your schedule, copy your Top Goal from the list of your current goals, paste it into your calendar for today's Top Goal, and then only work on this goal for the next 30 minutes. Do not respond to emails, texts, calls, etc. Only work on your Top Goal during these 30 minutes.

If you follow this pattern each workday, you will achieve amazing things.

\* McKeown recommends two hours per day for Top Goal. But as an investor, your primary task is to meet with new companies. You need to do this for many hours each day. Thirty minutes is a more realistic timeframe for an investor.
