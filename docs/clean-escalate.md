[Clean Escalate](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mDxWPYirGOvs1MxdCkI98U-_7lNjr_b10jclR_D-laQ/edit) (2 min)

"People come to me all the time and complain about others in the company. What do I do?"

Departments need to work collaboratively to get things done. Sales and Marketing must work together to both generate and then close leads. Product and Engineering must work together to understand customer problems and then build the features to solve those problems.

But what if Marketing feels that Sales is squandering the leads that they are giving them?

What if Product feels that Engineering ignores the product roadmap and builds whatever seems fun to build?

The Head of Marketing can't hire/fire the Head of Sales. The Head of Product can't hire/fire the Head of Engineering.

Instead, in frustration, the Head of Marketing will come to you, the CEO, and complain about the Head of Sales and demand that you rectify the problem. This action is a "dirty escalation." Escalation because they have escalated the issue up the org chart to you. Dirty because you are only hearing one side of the story.

It is fine to escalate, but the key is to do so cleanly. Clean would be if you, as Apex Manager, received a well-prepared presentation from each side at the same time so that you could make a well-informed decision.

(An Apex Manager is the manager that has fire/hire authority over both people involved in a disagreement. Often this is the CEO, but not always.)

The following is how Clean Escalation works in practice:

- Head of Marketing (HoM) has a problem with the Head of Sales (HoS).

- HoM first goes to HoS and clearly states the problem that she is experiencing and her proposed solution.

  - If the two agree on a solution, nothing more needs to be done.

  - If the two cannot agree on a solution, then they agree to do a Clean Escalation to their Apex Manager. Together, they reach out to their Apex Manager jointly and ask for a meeting.

- HoM and HoS prepare their positions in writing and submit them to the Apex Manager before the meeting.

- At the meeting, all read both documents. Apex Manager asks questions until she feels that she has enough context and then makes a decision.

  - It is OK for Apex Manager to ask for a mulligan.

    - I.e., "I need more information." If this happens, then …
      - Apex Manager must list out exactly what information she needs and who will collect that information.
      - The manager sets a new meeting time. Materials are written and submitted in advance.
      - At this second meeting, the Apex Manager makes a decision. No more mulligans\!

To ensure that clean escalations occur, you, as Apex Manager, must say "no" to all dirty escalations. Once you do, your company and your life will become cleaner\!
