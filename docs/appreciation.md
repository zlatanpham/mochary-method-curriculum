## [Appreciation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1id4TBGwDPuCvXiEW8RvJh-ajUuhrBnayoz9D1t1Gj3Y/edit) (1 min)

Appreciation is simply an outward extension of [Gratitude](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18kCULxudhpoSZNN-5m4G611YGNI92aZA-xrMjbF0juA/edit?usp=drive_web&ouid=102503928790226855337) (3 min). In Gratitude, you speak to yourself. In appreciation, you speak to others. The content is the same.

When you catch yourself feeling grateful about someone or something that they have done, let them know. When you hear something nice said about someone, let that person know.

The benefits of this practice are threefold:

1. The recipient will feel better about themselves. And we now know what happens when people feel better about themselves.
2. The recipient will feel connected and appreciative to you for having brought them this good feeling.
3. You will start to view the recipient more positively since you are now focusing on a positive aspect about them.

Chris Fralic of First Round Capital, in his [iconic blog post on networking](http://firstround.com/review/how-to-become-insanely-well-connected/), says that he reserves one hour each week for follow-ups and outreach, most of which include appreciations. I recommend that you do the same.
