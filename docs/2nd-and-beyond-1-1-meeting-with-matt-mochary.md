#### **\[Date of meeting\]**

##### **Good**

- Company
  - \[Write here\]
- Me
  - \[Write here\]

##### **Actions from Last (YES/NO, WHY/HABIT)**

- Cut and paste the Actions to Next from our last meeting here.
- Then mark each action **YES** or **NO** as to whether you completed it.
- For any NO, please also write:
  - **WHY?** State why you didn't complete the action. If the reason was that you de-prioritized the action (i.e., not doing it was the right thing to do), then you are done.
- If the reason was anything else, then please also write:
  - **HABIT?** What habit can you adopt so that you don't reencounter this obstacle? And, what action do you need to take to complete the original action?
- Here is a template for NO that you can copy-paste:
  - \[Action from last\]
    - **NO**
    - **WHY?**
      - **\[State why\]**
    - **HABIT?**
      - **\[State the habit you can adopt\]**
