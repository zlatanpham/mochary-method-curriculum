[Fundraising: The Relationship Method](https://docs.google.com/document/d/163t4I3CzQ-CUScBYp6fCxpboSgHxCB7syd4Jtzw7nco/edit?usp=sharing) (8 min)

### Introductions

The introduction is a vital part of the fundraising process, and you only get one chance at it. I recommend using the Triangulation Method.

When you want to be introduced to an investor, first find three to five people in your network who know that person. Then ask each to send an email to the target investor, letting her know how great they think you are, and highly recommending that she meet with you. After receiving several such emails, the investor will proactively reach out to you. She has received recommendations before, but never three or more for the same person. She concludes that you and your company must be truly great, so she is already inclined to invest in you before she even meets you.

From your side, stack all of the referrals in a short period (within a week). You are trying to achieve critical mass and have your referrals rise above the noise of other referrals.

It's important not to hand each referrer the same potential text to send onward. If they end up sending the same language, then the referrals are revealed to be orchestrated by you. Therefore, either give your referrers different suggested language or no suggestion at all.

### Two Methods

There are two ways to raise money: the Traditional Method and the Relationship Method.

The Traditional Method is when you pitch an investment firm with your story, most often with a slide deck, describing the customer problem, solution, market size, unit economics, financial projections, competition, team members, traction, go-to-market strategy, and so on. You might run through your presentation dozens of times before you find a spark of interest in either you or your company.

The Relationship Method is to build a trusting, friendly relationship with an investor before discussing what your company does. This process takes more time, but it dramatically increases the close rate. This strategy works because we are most often guided by our emotional responses no matter how rational we appear. We make instinctive, gut choices, and our rational brains do an excellent job of retrofitting logic over those choices.

The first time you talk about your company, the investor will decide whether or not she wants to invest. If she does not yet like or trust you, then your company had better be optically perfect—and more often than not, it isn't. So, the key is to wait to talk about your company until you are sure that the investor likes and trusts you personally. By then, the investor will have a positive bias toward you and will be inclined to invest in your company, warts and all.

But how do you get the investor to like and trust you?

### Build trust and like

Think about the people you like. Do you want people who just talk about themselves and show no interest or curiosity about you and your life? Or do you like people who ask about you, listen attentively, and are genuinely curious about what makes you tick?

When meeting potential investors for the first time, ask them about themselves. Get genuinely curious about their lives, both at work and home. Ask them lots of questions. Prove to them you're listening by saying, "I think I heard you say…" and then repeating back to them the highlights of what they said to you. When the meeting ends, write down as much information about the person as you remember.

At your next meeting with them, say, "The last time we talked, you said…" and again repeat the highlights. It is heartwarming when we find someone who cares enough about the details of our lives to remember them.

Also, let them know what they have done that you appreciate. If nothing else, you can always appreciate that they took the time to meet with you.

But how do you get a meeting in the first place without the explicit purpose of talking about your company? You can use the Triangulation Method outlined above, but if you don't have enough mutual acquaintances, you can simply ask for it. Be explicit about your intent to build a relationship. Say something like, "We only want to work with investors with whom we have a good relationship. So let's start with a coffee to get to know each other personally."

After the first meeting, ask for a second. Since the stated purpose is to build a relationship, the investor is likely to say yes. If you have truly allowed them to speak about themselves, they will have enjoyed the meeting and look forward to another.

These meetings do not need to be long, nor do they need to be in person. A fifteen-minute phone call can be as effective as a one-hour meal if, after time has passed, you demonstrate genuine care and a memory for the details of their life. After two meetings like this, they will trust and like you when you listen to them and reflect on what they say. Several more, and they will love you. You'll know when the moment comes that they like and trust you. They will likely say it. If not, their body language will show it.

You can then talk about your company with the confidence that they are already inclined to invest. If you aren't good at reading body language, just wait. At some point, they will say something like (and this is an actual quote from an investor): "I really like you. I want to invest in you. Now tell me what your company does."

To summarize, the four keys are:

1. Ask them about their lives.
2. Prove that you heard by saying, "I think I heard you say ...:"
3. Prove that you remember by saying at the next meeting, "The last time we talked, you said …."
4. Let them know what you appreciate about them.

If you do all four of these things, you will have created a bond and have a willing investor.

When most CEOs hear of this method for the first time, they have a strong adverse reaction. This method feels unnatural and goes against their instincts to close quickly. Later, once they have tried the method, and it works like a charm, they become raving fans. Therefore, my best advice is to try it on a few prospective investors and see if it is more effective than the traditional approach.

### Strengthening the Relationship

Once you have met with someone a couple of times and demonstrated your memory and care for their lives, you have created a relationship. This is likely enough for them to like you. But why settle for just enough? To further strengthen the relationship, continue to be curious about them, and show them that you remember what they say. Three to five rounds of contact will solidify the relationship. Not everyone needs to be an in-person meeting—it can be enough to send a quick message, as when someone sent me this email:

_Matt,_

_Your old house, no??_

_Peter_

I felt honored that he remembered where I used to live. And I now feel even more connected to him.

Lest you think this is a tactic that only over-aggressive young CEOs use, know that the person who sent this message is a very wealthy retired CEO/founder who wants nothing. He was just genuinely reminded about me.

Below is another example, a message of appreciation, which comes from a Managing Partner at one of the most successful investment firms in the world.

_Hey Matt,_

_Just wanted to drop a note of thanks. I really enjoyed our talk on Tuesday and brief ones since. Also greatly appreciate you treating me to lunch. Talk soon\!_

_Bill_

I feel honored that he took the time to appreciate me.

The following comes from Andy Bromberg, Founding CEO of CoinList, who takes it a step further:

_At the risk of giving up my secrets, I'd suggest handwritten thank you notes. The response I get to my handwritten notes is incredible. People are floored. And often remember me as "the handwritten note guy."_

So make it a practice to regularly go through your contact list and send out messages of appreciation. You will be shocked by the massive goodwill that it generates. Andy suggests making this a formal process—he says, "Every day I review all my interactions and send (or schedule) thank you's as appropriate. It ensures I don't miss anyone and am prompt. And it takes literally a few minutes."

### Sell Yourself, Not Your Company

Cliff Weitzman, CEO of Speechify, realized that it was key to sell himself and not his company. If he could do so, he would gain investors for life—investors who would follow him through every pivot and company. So, when Cliff realized that he had established trust and like, he shared the story of his life—using a method that his brother Tyler had discovered.

Tyler Weitzman, CEO of BlackSMS, is a unique guy. He likes to research social situations. As an undergrad at Stanford, he explored a method for conveying one's achievements (or bragging, if you prefer\!) while remaining humble and relatable. Through countless interviews of master storytellers, Tyler determined the ultimate structure for humbly telling one's story:

\- **Credit**: "It could not have happened without \[name the others involved\]."

\- **Hard Work**: "We had to put in so much to make it happen, for example, \[describe the hard work\]."

\- **Vulnerability**: "It was most difficult for me when…."

\- **Duty**: "Our dream drove us to \[noble motive\]."

\- **Gratitude**: "I am so proud and thankful that…."

I encourage you to tell your story to a friend using this exact structure. See what comes out. Ask your friend for her reaction. I think you will be amazed.

Here is an example of this method:

### Acknowledgment

This book could not have happened without all the people that I have coached, and who coach me, including Chris Barber, Misha Talavera, Karissa Paddie, Ryan Breslow, Alex MacCaw, Naval Ravikant, Brian Armstrong, Tatiana Dorow, Alexander Kasser, and Stephen Mochary.

We each had to put in so much to make this book happen. Chris Barber "found" me and invited me to coach his roommates at Stanford, which launched my coaching career. Misha, Ryan and Alex, whom I coached, forced me to get these writings into the world. Naval read the draft and said it was the best business book he'd seen (whether true or not, that's what he told me), further encouraging me to get it out into the world. My wife, Tatiana Dorow, well, she just makes my life great by making me laugh each and every day. Alexander Kasser, my grandfather, made me feel that I could never fail, no matter how hard I swung the bat. And Stephen Mochary, my dad, has always been my best friend and biggest fan.

Writing this book was most difficult for me when it was almost done. I very much enjoyed writing the content. But the final stages of editing and formatting felt like "work." Luckily, Alex pushed me through those tasks.

As a group, what drove us was our dream of sharing this information with the world so that CEOs and companies could be more efficient and effective.

I am so proud and thankful that I got a chance to work with this amazing group of people. My wish for you is that you, too, get the chance to experience the joy of coaching others one day. It is the most deeply satisfying activity that I have yet found in life. (If you know of anything more satisfying, please let me know\!)
