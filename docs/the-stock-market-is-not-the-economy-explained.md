[The stock market is not the economy … explained](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PWqUwM7mR2LtGVdQxlktbJKix_kNAUfm99QY9cKQtmg/edit) (2 min)

We are all seeing the stock market rise as mass layoffs continue and US GDP craters. Many are asking: How is this possible?

Here's how …

On March 23, 2020, the US government stated that it would do unlimited amounts of Quantitative Easing (buying illiquid debt from banks) and direct corporate debt purchases. Quantitative Easing was innovated in 2008 and was used to purchase banks' bad debt (caused by massive defaults on home mortgages). In 2020, the same technique was being used but now includes buying new debt directly from companies.

Do not be confused by the fancy words here. All this means is that the US government is handing trillions of dollars to banks and large corporations. And is asking for close to 0% interest in return.

What will the beneficiaries do with that money? What is the best investment right now?

Will they build new factories and hire more workers? No. Consumer demand has fallen off a cliff as people shelter-in-place and hope to have enough money to buy food and pay the rent.

Will they lend it to small business owners to re-open their businesses? Unlikely. No one is buying right now, so re-opening a small business looks like a bad credit risk.

Will they buy US Treasuries? No. Those are safe stores of capital, but the interest they pay now is close to zero.

So, what remains? Equities.

Investors realize that the beneficiaries of the government's largesse are going to use that capital to buy equities because the loans don't need to get repaid for many years. US GDP will be restored in that time, and those same equities will once again be attached to significant cash flow.

When investing in a company, an investor looks at the future cash flows that the company will produce (usually five years out) and discounts that cash flow to today's value, discounting by the cost of capital. With 0% cost of capital, $10 of cash flow in 5 years is worth $10 today. Investors can therefore look past whatever massive losses occur in the next few months or even years and simply look at profits 3, 4, 5 years from now and be willing to pay dollar for dollar for those profits today.

That is why the stock market goes up, as the economy crumbles, millions lose their jobs and any ability to pay for housing, food, etc.

The sad part about all of this is that those same trillions of dollars used to lend to banks and corporations, who will most likely simply use it to buy stocks (often their own), could have instead been sent directly to every person in the US. Had the government done that, people would keep their homes, put food on the table, and start spending again to restart the economy.

Instead, investors (like me) get richer, while those who rely on a job for their money are put on the street.

This tool (the government buying bad debt) was used in 2008 in a big way. Politicians and economists feared that there would be mass uprisings as taxpayers realized that their dollars had been used to bail out the investors in the very banks that had created the crisis. But the uprising never came.

So, politicians (on both sides of the aisle) learned that they had just discovered a magic bullet. They now had a way of propping up the stock market (which they could point to as evidence of a "strong economy" and get re-elected) with no downside consequence to their political career.

So, in 2020, they took that tool and brought it from large to absolutely massive. Will there be an uprising now? I am sad to say … I don't think so.

Will the market crash again as investors realize just how much economic devastation has been sustained (2Q GDP down \>30%, unemployment \>25%, etc.)? Maybe. But this too will be temporary because zero cost of capital decouples the stock market from today's economy, instead of tying it to the economy five years from now.
