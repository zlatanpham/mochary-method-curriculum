## [To IPO, or not to IPO?](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ond3aXqWutjbut4fBT5HBlRXBGlUZ37B0f5d2VU12RM/edit?usp=sharing) (3 min)

That is the question.

When your company is doing well, many people will want you to take the company public: investors, employees, advisors, friends, family, etc. Publicly-traded shares create the most liquidity at (usually) the highest price for investors and employees alike. The company's lawyers, bankers, and accountants make tremendous fees at the IPO and subsequent transactions. Friends and family members take pride in your company being publicly traded.

With all of these incentives in place, an IPO may feel like a foregone conclusion. **It's not\!**

Publicly-traded shares do give a company financial flexibility. But they remove operational flexibility. A pernicious cascade of unintended consequences gets put in place upon an IPO that leads to a set of virtual shackles being placed on your (and your company's) ankles and wrists.

Here's how it works:

The strength of your company's equity value allows you to retain great team members and acquire accretive companies. If your stock value drops significantly and for a sustained period, many of your best people will leave (as the value of their options will have dried up, and they can get hired elsewhere). Likewise, acquisitions will become too expensive to make. These dynamics will negatively and materially impact your ability to run the company well. Therefore, you will do whatever you can to ensure that the stock price does not drop significantly. And this is where the cascade begins.

Each quarter, you will have to forecast next quarter's performance and report on last quarter's actuals. There will be pressure to project growth each and every quarter. If not, shareholders will sell. Once projected, there will be even greater pressure to meet or exceed these projections. If not, shareholders will sell. The hamster wheel has begun to spin.

Now enter the short-sellers who believe that you will at some point fall off of this hamster wheel. They take a short position in your stock, and suddenly their incentive is to show the world all the worst things about your company so that the stock price drops now. Some of these short-sellers have integrity; some don't. Those who don't are willing to spread rumors, lies, and innuendo. While they may be dealing in fiction, the consequences for you are very real.

And finally, there are the very real costs of satisfying the SEC's reporting requirements (Sarbanes-Oxley). This likely costs several million dollars a year in accounting and legal fees. But even more costly is the significant management overhead involved.

These days, the private markets offer tremendous capital (i.e., Softbank, sovereign wealth funds, Tiger Global, Coatue, GV, etc.) at strong valuations. Before creating public equity, reach out to public company CEOs and ask them what the cost/benefit really is.

Mark Zuckerberg famously wanted to keep Facebook private forever. But because many of his employees were exercising their options and selling on the secondary market to create liquidity, the company was at risk of exceeding 500 "owners." At this threshold, the SEC requires that a company have publicly-traded shares. In order not to run afoul of the law, Facebook went public.

Having seen this example, Palantir partnered with a secondary fund to offer liquidity to its employees so that they would never trip the 500+ owner barrier.

Instead of giving in to all the voices around you (particularly from your institutional venture investors) that want you to go public, consider staying private. Capital is abundant in this world. Operational freedom, once lost, is tough to regain.

I don't want to minimize the positives of going public. They are there. It certainly makes fundraising easier if your company is performing well. From one such company's CEO:

"I will say, it is much easier to raise money as a public company. We recently raised $x billion in debt, and the entire process took one week, and I didn't have to do a single meeting. My CFO had to do a bunch of meetings, but totally different from private company raise that would derail my life for 1-2 months."

If you do choose to go public, here are some bits of advice from the CEOs I coach who have already done so:

- Don't do the roadshow in person.

  - Brian Armstrong (Coinbase) has an even more radical idea:
    - Don't do individual meetings.
    - Instead, schedule 3 meetings.
      - One with Fidelity, BlackRock, and one other major.
      - Let all potential investors know the days and times to pick one that works for them.
      - During each meeting, engage in a Q\&A with the major investor. Once that major investor has completed their questions, open it up to a few others.
  - I think there does need to be individual relationship-building. But that can happen after the general session gets all the basics of company information out of the way. Then the relationship-building meetings can focus on ... relationship-building.
  - Raise a smaller amount, then expand if needed, so you don't worry about it.
  - Let the CFO do all the blocking and tackling, i.e., select the service providers, prepare all the documents, the story, do the follow-up meetings, etc.

- Prepare your team for volatile markets heavily **over and over**. See [IPO: message to your team](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oWVdHPK5vuzfOK4Onojo9xjYBFvaM18cNxLk9wVcJxI/edit) (1 min).
