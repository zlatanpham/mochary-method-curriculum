- You are the CEO.

- You have pain\!
  - Have achieved PMF and are now scaling.
  - Team of \>50.
  - This is the first time you've ever managed a team this large.
  - You don't have a good way to create alignment, accountability and velocity throughout your company.
  - You've hired a lot of great people, but you don't know exactly what they're doing, so you're not sure if they are intending to do the most important things, nor if they are doing what they said they would, nor how fast they are doing them.  

- You are a fan\!
  - You are a fan of Mochary Method and want to see how Matt Mochary himself would implement it in the company.
  - So eager to see this, that youâ€™re willing to use beta software with no QA testing and no sandbox, where code pushes (and bugs\!) are introduced daily. You become the QA tester\!
  - In the Americas time zone.  

- You have the money\!
  - In such dire need, that you would gladly pay $12,500 per month to create alignment, accountability and velocity throughout your company.
  - More than $50mm cash in the bank, or over $10mm in annualized profits.
