[Matt talking about the importance of Absolute Feedback and how to give it](https://www.loom.com/share/057942f6a7df479294adc1f9ab1d16e8?sid=2f82ddab-3322-4225-a224-ff95ede6a470) (3 min)

People need to know where they stand on an absolute basis. Do not wait until year-end Performance Reviews. Most people have constant anxiety when they aren't sure where they stand.

Giving absolute feedback regularly (usually monthly in a 1-1) will eliminate this anxiety. Bad news is less anxiety-inducing than no news. It will also give a team member clear guidance on how best to help the company succeed\!

To give it, state:

- **Your current rating for your job function, 1-5, is …**
  - 1 – couldn’t be any worse
  - 3 – meeting expectations
  - 5 – couldn’t be any better
- **What you did that I liked…**
  -
- **What you need to do to get to the next level…**
  -
