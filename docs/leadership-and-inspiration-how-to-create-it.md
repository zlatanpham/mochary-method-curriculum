[Leadership and Inspiration: How to create it](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PTcxTzNFIh1gbBdyC8F0hRLLPh7CFt1XRCwzS0SZku8/edit) (6 min)

Many of the CEOs I work with have asked me, "How do I become a more inspiring leader?"

The answer has many parts.

Fundamentally, people want to feel that the company where they work is:

- Solving a meaningful problem
- For real living beings
- On the path to winning

In addition, each person wants to feel that:

- Her positive contributions are needed for the company to win (_this is where you create a sense of urgency_)
- She knows what she is doing well and what she needs to do to improve
- Others are pulling as just as hard as she is

And finally, that the decision-makers:

- Know and care about her concerns, and make decisions accordingly
- Are telling her the truth about the company's progress, challenges, etc. (the good and the bad, their raw thoughts and feelings)

Each of these requires a different action. If all are done, then people will feel inspired to work at your company. Let's look at how to achieve each.

1. Solving a meaningful problem

   1. For this, you must write out a Mission that addresses a real problem people can identify. Be bold. Don't worry about turning off 97% of the population. You only need fierce buy-in from less than 1% of the population. So, be very bold in clearly stating the specific problem that you are trying to solve.

2. For real living beings

   1. In the Vision, identify exactly who has this problem.
      1. Let's look to the most successful form of inspiring humans ever invented: the Hollywood narrative film. In its most basic form, a Hollywood movie identifies a protagonist. It makes the protagonist relatable, and therefore likable. It then puts that protagonist in real danger. We then begin to cheer and root for the protagonist. You need to do the same in your Vision statement.
         1. Pick one real living example of your customer. (Almost always, this is a human who is deciding to pay you money.)
         2. Describe the personal traits of this person. Make her relatable. This description is what will make us like her.
            1. How old is she? Where does she live, and what does she do? Is she married with kids? Does she have a pet? If yes, what are all their names? What are her hopes and fears? What gives her joy, sadness, and anger?
         3. Show us the problem that she has (i.e., the danger that she is facing).
         4. Because we already like her, we are now trying hard to solve her problem and save her from this danger.

3. On the path to winning

   1. Once you have created a meaningful Mission and a Vision with a worthy protagonist, you now need to clearly show the path to winning and declare whether you are still on this path or not.
      1. The most meaningful and sustainable path to winning is to
         1. First, create a unique solution that is 10x better than the existing solutions.
         2. Then, create a moat that makes it nigh-impossible for anyone else to supplant you.
      2. You should describe Both of these in your Vision.
   2. And then, in each update to the company, you must show the progress you are making both toward the Product Vision and toward the Moat.

4. Her positive contributions are needed for the company to win.

   1. Each employee wants to feel that they are a crucial part of the company's success. The easiest way to do this is to create quarterly company OKRs (I prefer three or less) that cover every function in the company (Product, People, Profits). Then department OKRs feed into one or more of the company OKRs. Then team OKRs that clearly feed into one or more of the department OKRs. Then individual OKRs that clearly feed into one or more of the team OKRs. Thus a clear causal pathway is created from the individual's OKRs to the company's OKRs which are mission-critical for success.
   2. In every 1-1, have each Manager point out this direct causal connection. It takes less than 1 minute to do.

5. She knows what she is doing well and what she needs to do to improve.

   1. Everyone wants to perform well. They want to know whether they are and what they can do to improve. And they want to know this near-constantly so that they can adjust, instead of once every six months during performance reviews (when it's too late for them to do anything about it).
   2. Therefore give feedback regularly:
      1. Praise individuals in every team meeting. (Remember to praise those doing the critical but non-sexy jobs.)
   3. Give critical feedback in the 1-1. (Always synchronously, i.e., in person or via phone)

6. Others are pulling as just as hard as she is

   1. No one wants to feel that they are the only ones working. And without specific knowledge that others are pulling their weight, our brain creates conspiracy theories that they are not. And then we ask ourselves, "Why should I work so hard if others aren't?" Then we begin to slack off, and the conspiracy theories become true.
   2. To counter this, create absolute transparency across the company of what all other people are doing.
      1. The easiest way that I know of to do this is to use a tool (that everyone knows how to use) that tracks actions and/or progress toward OKRs.
         1. Examples include Asana, Perdoo, Jira, etc.
         2. A current best practice that I have seen is:
            1. Jira for Engineering
            2. Asana for everyone else
            3. I look forward to the day when this can become a single tool.

7. Decision-makers know and care about her concerns and make decisions accordingly.

   1. People want to feel heard. The easiest way that I know of to do this is for every manager to regularly (in 1-1s and team meetings) ask each of their reports:
      1. What issue do you see in the company, and what solution do you propose?
      2. What issue do you see in my behavior, and what request would you like to make?
   2. Treat the answers to these questions like the gold that they are:
      1. Thank your report for sharing them.
      2. Repeat them back to prove that you actually heard the intent.
      3. Act on them if you agree that they are valid.
   3. If each manager is doing this, then Issues and Proposed Solutions will quickly get sucked up the chain until you make a decision.

8. Decision-makers are telling her the truth about the company's progress, challenges, etc. (the good and the bad, their raw thoughts and feelings)

   1. At All Hands and in weekly emails to the company, simply tell the raw truth. Do not hide challenges and setbacks. Instead, bare them openly. This step will create deep trust.
   2. Not only share the facts, but also share your thoughts and, most importantly, your feelings.

      1. “Since I communicated with you last, here is what made me feel Joy and Excitement. And here is what made me feel Sadness, Fear, and Anger.”
      2. This transparency of thought and emotion will make you relatable, just like the Protagonist in the Hollywood film. It will create trust and connection with your team.
      3. If you want help in sharing transparently and vulnerably, get a good public speaking coach. They are inexpensive relative to the massive value that they can deliver.

   3. Once you correctly identify the problems and concerns, then state exactly what you are going to do to address them.

So, for people to feel fully inspired, all of the above must be occurring. But if you want to jumpstart things, start with being transparent and vulnerable in All Hands. You will be shocked at the positive reception.
