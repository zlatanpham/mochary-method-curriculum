In the book Turn the Ship Around, L. David Marquet recounts his assignment as commander of the worst-performing submarine in the US Navy’s fleet and his superior’s request that he “turn the ship around.”

The normal trajectory of a Navy sub commander’s career is to learn every job on a submarine (through rotations to each department) and then eventually become commander. The commander then makes all decisions in the operations of the vessel. The decisions are often sound, but they don’t come fast.

Marquet was brought up on one class of submarine, and indeed knew all of the jobs on it. He was a very promising officer. But then he wasn’t assigned to command that type of sub. Instead, he was asked to turn around the Navy’s worst-performing sub. It was a completely different class of sub than he had trained on, and he didn’t know how anything operated.

Out of sheer necessity, he couldn’t make the decisions, but rather had to rely on his department heads to make the decisions. **Marquet simply asked the department heads to let him know what those decisions were before they performed the action, so that Marquet could ask questions or give feedback.**

But to make it clear that the department heads should go ahead and act if Marquet weren’t available, he had them always say **“I intend to ….”** That way, if Marquet wasn’t available to give feedback, the department would go ahead and act anyway. And even if Marquet gave dissenting feedback, the department head was still encouraged to do what they thought best, simply knowing that they also owned the results.

Marquet prayed that nothing disastrous would happen.

Instead, something miraculous happened.

First, department heads started coming to Marquet earlier and earlier with well thought out decisions. The actions occurred whether or not Marquet was available for feedback, so overall operations sped up dramatically. Whenever Marquet _did_ have questions, they were often about how the decision would affect other departments.

Soon, department heads started presenting this information proactively for Marquat before he even asked. Because of this, each department head started thinking like a commander (assessing how each decision would affect all the departments and not just their own).

**This shift in mentality led to two amazing outcomes:**

1. Not only did the sub turn around: it became the best-performing sub in the fleet after several years.  

2. Prior to Marquet taking over, the sub had the lowest % of promotions of any crew in the fleet. After several years, it then had the highest % of promotions. The department heads who were thinking like commanders every time they said, “I intend to …” were effectively training themselves for the commander job. This was recognized, and they were promoted to commander more than any other sub’s crew.

I (Matt) have applied this same technique inside the Mochary Method’s small team. The results have been remarkable. I feel fully informed, but I am no longer the bottleneck. And the quality of decisions, actions, and buy-in from the team has gone up dramatically.

This technique is now being used in many of the companies that I coach, and the CEOs all report positive results.
