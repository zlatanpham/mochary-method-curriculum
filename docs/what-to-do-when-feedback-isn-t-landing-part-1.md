[**What to do when feedback isn’t landing due to Clarity and Capability**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tsqGVufCXilMKmL6uaZLyvzirhj0Tmb_PfNc_OWWPb8/edit?usp=sharing) **(3 mins)**

You’ve read [Feedback](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wi714sobuQP72sKXw6J_gkwkhtVh1t6--op_Pk0YPxA/edit) (15 min). You’ve tried implementing it. But you’ve now run into a common issue: unresponsive feedback recipients, aka feedback not landing. Here’s how it might show up in a coaching session: the CEO client says: "My SVP isn't responding to feedback, despite several discussions. I'm starting to question whether their promotion was premature."

When it comes to a lack of response to feedback, the answer might be contained in the Three C’s of Feedback Dynamics:

1. **Clarity** \- Is your feedback request clear, behavioral and unambiguous?
2. **Capability** \- Does the feedback recipient have the tools and skills required to act?
3. **Caring** \- Do they have the motivation or drive to follow through?

In this article let’s deal with Clarity and Capability: situations where folks are willing but not able to incorporate feedback.

1. **Clarity, or The Mind-Reader problem**:

Imagine telling your SVP, "Increase visibility in the Sales CRM." But what does "visibility" truly entail? You are asking them to read your mind. Instead, **outline the specific actions you expect**, such as, "Update deal blockers daily in the CRM for our sales meetings, so I can help you unblock them."

How can you be truly specific in your feedback requests?

- A video camera should be able to capture the behavior you request
  - For example, a video camera could capture this request: “Please text me if you’re going to be more than a minute late to our meetings”
  - However, this request cannot be captured by a video camera: “Please be more punctual”
- Would you be satisfied if they exhibited the requested behavior?

2. **Capability, or The "Why Can't My Five-Year-Old Drive '' Problem:**

If you ask a five year old to drive, he can’t: he lacks the training, the hand-eye coordination, and he’s not tall enough to see over the wheel. Similarly, if you ask a fresh graduate to do the work of a seasoned VP, they can’t: they lack the required expertise. **Ask yourself \- or even better, ask them \- how you might help them build the capability to do the job.**

- Do they need training?
- Can the task be broken into manageable steps?
- Are additional resources \- money, time, political capital \- necessary?

To facilitate improvement, consider the **"I Intend To…" Exercise:** Ask the feedback recipient to send you an "[I intend to…](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bhqRW65zsHHIuv-jWOKx9Aidqfys4zDe0UV9fYH8BkI/edit?usp=sharing)" statement before acting. This prompts them to identify the issue and outline their approach. As you review their intentions, you can offer guidance and adjustments, aiding their skill development.

**TLDR**: If your direct report is not responding to feedback and you suspect it’s because of capability (not willingness), make your feedback specific and behavioral, help them build the ability to do the work, and provide positive reinforcement. By doing this you can help your employee grow into their role through feedback.
