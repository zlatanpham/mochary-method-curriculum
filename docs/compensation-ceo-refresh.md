[Compensation: CEO refresh](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DkMfwxNO8EGpTrSxwbye-XRqRIjdxMSjeeco6IXHQgc/edit)

Yes, there is such a thing. Investors hate it. But in the end, they grant it. Because it’s market. And their alternative is a terrible one.

On the one hand, investors want you to feel like a major owner already and not need any more ownership to incent you.

On the other hand, if the company had to hire a CEO, they would likely need to make a 4-year grant of 3-10% of the company, depending on its size. And with that hire would come significant risk, because a significant % of hired gun CEOs fail. Would the board rather retain you at 60% of this amount? If you are performing, then “Yes, without a doubt.”

But don’t ask for this amount yourself. For many board members, especially less experienced ones, they will feel offended by this ask. Some very offended. (More senior board members have already been through this a few times, and are already over it.)

Better to hire a good compensation firm like [Semler Brossy](https://semlerbrossy.com/%20) (Todd Sirras [tsirras@semlerbrossy.com](mailto:tsirras@semlerbrossy.com)), Compensia or Alpine Rewards (formerly Radford Partners) to present the market data. And then have someone represent you in the negotiation. Let the representative be the bad cop. The company should pay for both the market comp data and your representation, as those are legitimate corporate expenses.

The charge from the comp consultant will be about $100,000. Each of your venture investors already has the data of what their portfolio CEO refreshes are. If you want to save the $100,000, and trust your investors to share with you what the market data really is, you can simply ask them what their portfolio CEOs are getting. If you have any doubt at all that they will share with you the real information, use an external consultant.

As of late 2020, the market for CEO refresh seemed to be 3% with 4 year-vesting.

As of early 2023, a new and interesting option has appeared:

- 5% total over 4 years. But 25% granted each year for 4 years.
  - So, in year 1 a grant of 1.25% is given with a 4 year vest.
  - In year 2, another grant of 1.25% is given with a 4 year vest.
  - Etc.

### IPO

Before going public, make sure that you put in 20x super-majority voting shares for yourself. Brian Armstrong of Coinbase has said that he “would not consider going public without it. There are enough comps now where it is considered standard and no major investors had issue with it.”
