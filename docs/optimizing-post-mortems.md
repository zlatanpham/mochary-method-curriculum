Post mortems/retros can be one of the most powerful tools in your arsenal to boost morale, and accelerate your teams’ performance and growth through clear communication and transparency.

If you’ve never run one before, a post mortem or retro are designed to assess what went well and what went wrong/could be improved as a group to capture key learnings/insights to “know better, do better” and set the whole team up for enhanced success going forward.

Post mortems are generally done upon project completion, but for projects with long timelines, I’d strongly recommend that you do not wait for the project to finish — communicate early and often with the team and learn and improve as you go.

Here are some time-tested tips for how to run the most effective post mortems:

1. **All key parties should do the pre-work.**

   - Meetings are expensive. Get right to the point by mandating that your team do the pre-thinking ahead of time.
   - I’m a fan of giving my team pre-set questions to answer prior to the group meeting. I personally would use a Google Doc to collate answers. Others have used questionnaires, Notion… choose whatever method has the lowest friction — i.e. use whatever platform your team is most comfortable with.

2. **Hold the space for both the negatives and positives.**

   - The words “post mortem” often have a slightly negative connotation, and the biggest mistake I see teams make is focusing only on what went wrong and not checking in on what’s working well.
   - In the pre-work and/or the meeting, ask your team to consider what went/is going really well? What’s working from what you all set out to do?

3. **Let the pre-work inform the agenda and assign a DRI for keeping the meeting on track.**

   - Once you’ve received everyone’s pre-written answers/input, take time to read through them and suss out key themes to cover in the meeting. Use whatever emerges to influence the agenda for the session.
   - **General best agenda practices include the four Rs:**
     1. **Revisit** the initial goals of the project, the metrics, and the “why” behind the project.
     2. **Review** the results.
     3. **Reassess**. This is the bulk of the meeting. What worked? What didn’t? How are people feeling? What have we learned?
     4. **Regroup.** Make a clear plan going forward based on the key learnings.
   - The DRI should time box the conversation and bring the group back to the key points if and when the conversation digresses.

4. **Assign a [DRI](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1I4jBy1XryEdknFoDCMUY93PEn0rR-oOOx6yiLSiaa38/edit) for maintaining documentation and tracking outcomes.**

   - Make certain that one person is responsible for capturing key takeaways, next steps and insights from the meeting.

5. **Set clear actions and accountability for key learnings and share them out to the team.**
   - At the end of the session, do a repeat back out loud of what each person’s next steps are, what precisely they intend to do, and when exactly they’ll take those next steps by.
   - The DRI should capture these key actions and dates, as well as other high level key learnings that need to be preserved and revisited going forward.
   - Share out these learnings and takeaways with the collective team and hold each other accountable to any shared agreements made during the post mortem review\!
