### About this doc

Below is a template for aligning a company on desired outcomes (goals) and actions (to-do’s to get to those goals.) The end goal is for every team member’s individual actions to connect to the larger company vision and desired outcomes.

It’s broken down into these categories:

- Customer discovery and revenue
- Outcomes (company, department, and individual levels)
- Actions (company, department, and individual levels)

_For the decision maker:_  
**Please send this template to whomever you would like input from when it comes to forming the company outcomes and actions.** You should send it only to the people whose responses you’re willing to read. (If you’re \<20 people, you can likely send and process the entire company’s input. For any teams larger than that, try to select for a pool that is representative of the overall company.)

Once you’ve received everyone’s answers, process them with the appropriate department heads, and then publish the results and findings once they are ready to the entire company.
