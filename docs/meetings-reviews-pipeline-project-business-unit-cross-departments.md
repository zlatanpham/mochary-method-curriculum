[Meetings: Reviews (Pipeline, Project/Business Unit, Cross-Departments)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1l_paluPfyck5y94FgNYrvrEsc1p9MEpmPHm5K10JRCk/edit) (2 min)

It is relatively easy to monitor a one-time task. Delegate it to someone, put it in a Task Tracker (ClickUp, Asana, Monday, etc.), and then check to see if and when it gets done.

But how to monitor a process? One with never-ending new tasks. Like a Recruiting firm meant to hire for a role. Or a Project or Business Unit's performance. Or the interaction between two tightly coupled Departments (i.e., Engineering and Product, or Sales and Marketing)

The answer is a regular Review Meeting.

For Recruiting, I schedule a 15-minute check-in once a week with the Recruiting firm where we look at the Candidate Pipeline (in a Google Sheet or Notion) and:

- Debrief each candidate that I have met so far
- Get briefed on each candidate that I have yet to meet
- Write down the next Actions and DRI (Directly Responsible Individual) for each candidate

For a Project or Business Unit, I schedule a monthly 50-minute Review Meeting where the Project of Business Owner walks me through:

- Whether or not they did the Actions agreed to in the last Review and the results of those Actions
- The current state of the Project/Business (Green, Yellow, Red), both
  - the Good
  - the Issues the have come up, and their Proposed Solutions
- What Actions do they plan to take in the next 30 days

For the interaction between two Departments that work closely together and, therefore, where there is often tension, rather than let that tension build into crisis, I schedule a monthly 80-minute Review where each Department head declares:

- Whether or not they did the Actions agreed to in the last Review
- What has worked well in the partnership in the previous 30 days
- What has not worked well, and a Proposed Solution to fix it
- Together, we then decide on Actions

If you want to ensure that these meetings are as effective and efficient as possible, ask all participants to submit their updates to you in writing in advance. It is still important to hear them verbally present (because you can only hear emotional undertone verbally). Still, the presentation will be more information-rich and efficient if they have written it (and you have read it) ahead of time.
