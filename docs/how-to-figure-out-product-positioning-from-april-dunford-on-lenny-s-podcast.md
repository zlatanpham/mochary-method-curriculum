This is an _internal_ exercise used by ELT to figure out the narrative on how to position their product in the market.

**Step 1: what am I positioning against?**  
_What is the current status quo? (Think pen and paper, spreadsheet, etc.)_  
_Who else would be on the short list of companies I have to be better than to win this contract?_

**Step 2: what makes us different?**  
_From the status quo and short list, how are we different?_  
_(This can be product features, pricing, customer service, etc.)_

**Step 3: “differentiated value”: So what? Why do these differentiators matter? What is the value this feature enables?**  
_Go through the list. You’ll find 2-3 buckets of “value themes” that are created for your customers._

**Step 4: best-fit customers: what does this customer in particular care about most from these “value themes”?**  
_What are the characteristics of the people who care about this product?_  
_Sell them on these points. Customers will care about different things, so having different value themes helps make the sale better._

**Step 5: market category: what’s the context I position this in that makes the product value obvious to the people I’m going after?**  
_Position the value to that market category so it becomes obvious why the key decision maker should buy from you._
