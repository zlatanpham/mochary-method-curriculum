So, you have ignored my advice and chosen to go public. So be it. Well then, at least choose your investors wisely.

You are likely thinking: "I can't choose my public equity investors. They choose me."

Not if you tell the right story.

Jeff Bezos was a public equity investor (worked at hedge fund DE Shaw), so he knew well which kind of investors he wanted and didn't. He knew that he wanted a stable stock price over time, and thus investors who would hold for the long-term and not bail when things looked bad (i.e., profits didn't materialize). But how to attract long-term holders?

**The answer:** Scare away short-term investors. And the vehicle to do this is the IPO Founder Letter.

In his letter, Jeff famously encouraged investors to punish the company if it ever showed a large profit because that meant that it wasn't sufficiently investing in long-term growth. The vast majority of investors want to see significant profits, and they want to see them now. Only true believers (akin to religious zealots\!) want the company to bury all its profits back into the company. And of course, when the company has no profits, there is no way for the public investor to really know if it's because the company is investing in the business, or the business just isn't that good and isn't producing much profit in the first place.

The ploy worked. Jeff attracted mostly true believers who allowed him to show almost no profits for ten years and still watch his stock price soar.

If you want to be treated that well, use your Founder Letter to scare away the faint of heart.
