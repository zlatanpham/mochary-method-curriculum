[Meetings: Exec Team meeting at Newfront](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13CgB7Z4HOG8V2NO6Paf3xTnqmdMlLodc2BgITCzhxeo/edit?folder=0B9tanFUuwmYSMHIyU2pkYTZSVkU) (1 min)

- Each management team leader updates a weekly sync doc by 8 PM Sunday.
- Their updates consist of relevant progress towards their organizational OKRs and key initiatives.
- Individuals also have the opportunity to submit a "Topic" or "Decision" ahead of time that comes with a \~1-page write-up providing the group relevant context.
- Finally, there are recurring topics we have scheduled for the exec team to discuss (team performance, culture, metrics, budgeting, etc.), which slot in on a more consistent basis.
- The meeting starts promptly at 8 AM on Monday, where the team is expected to be in the room, and laptops open for a 15 minute reading period where they review all the weekly updates, topics/decisions and share their input.
  - Suppose you've contributed materially ahead of time. In that case, you can show up at 8:15 for the discussion section, but the moderator (meeting owner) strictly enforces that if you show up late like that, you better have been an active participant in the document.
- We keep the first \~15-20 minutes of the meeting for each individual to have the opportunity to respond to any questions/comments in their section and stress specific points that are uniquely relevant to the group at large. It is OK for an individual to say "it's all in writing" and move on to the next person's section.
- Throughout the conversation, we record 1\) actions to the next and 2\) communications to the team. The second point is essential since some subset of the information discussed during the weekly management meeting should be disseminated through the organization's ranks. We've also organized our weekly team meetings to fast-follow the management meeting to ensure we distribute those sorts of messages.
- Finally, we spend the rest of our time \~30 minutes working through the proposed Topics and Decisions. We follow the Mochary framework relatively closely, where each leader comments on the topic at hand and shares their perspective. We do not utilize the second "Decision" \+ "Decision Comments" section of your template as we find it somewhat redundant to the first comments section.
- Generally speaking, the proposer will have sufficient context to offer up a decision and chart out the following steps (which the moderator enforces). Still, we can also open the discussion up to the group depending on the meatiness of the topic.

One of the skills required of the moderator is the ability to identify when going off-script from the structure meeting process is the optimal thing (we're talking about an important topic and having a productive conversation) versus when she should jump in to cut a conversation short.
