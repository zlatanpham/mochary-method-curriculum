[Leadership vs Team Leads Meeting](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OAdsheOc1RAS1-FC1PMImJ_sRGfug-SPamvTpu5P5vs/edit) (3 min)

As the company grows, each Team will become a large entity (i.e., Biz Ops, Design, Communications, Compliance, etc.). An individual product may grow large enough to warrant being its own business unit with its own GM. Thus there will be many VP-level execs. You will want to keep them informed and empowered. There will be a temptation to invite them to attend the Leadership Team meeting. Do not.

If someone needs to attend a meeting to be informed about what occurs or to have their voice fully represented, in that meeting, you have not yet created a transparent system.

Each meeting should have clear notes of all updates and decisions made (other than those around compensation and individual performance improvement). You should freely publish those notes to the company. So, everyone can know what happened in a meeting without actually attending. In addition, each employee should be encouraged, weekly, to write up any Issues they see in the company, their department, etc., and write up their Proposed Solution as well. These written Issues/Proposed Solutions are then elevated to the right decision-making meeting with the employee represented in her own written words.

The meeting then becomes a way of making good and fast decisions.

Your Brain Trust should attend the Leadership Meeting. Who are the essential minds that you need to hear from to make great decisions? And which people run the major business units that you need to make sure are continually unblocked? These should be the attendees of the Leadership Team meeting. Do not add any other attendees to assuage their ego. They will make the meeting less efficient.

(It is quite common for General Counsel and Chief People Officer to make Leadership Meetings inefficient. They often want to bring up endless non-strategic Issues/Proposed Solutions on legal and people-related issues. They often have a knee-jerk "no" response to many strategic decisions. They are risk managers. This is their training.

If this is happening in your meeting, be very clear with them about what is and isn't additive behavior, and continue to give the feedback until they are as additive as all others. If you cannot do that, then do not invite them to the Brain Trust meeting.)

For all the rest of your Department and Team Leads, there is a VPs (or Team Leads) Meeting. At this meeting, announce the decisions that were just made in the Leadership Meeting. There is then a "speak now or forever hold your peace" moment. If any of these decisions will have unintended negative consequences, now is the time for the VPs to raise their hand and say, "That is a terrible idea for these reasons …". The decision then gets kicked into a RAPID. But for the vast majority of decisions, the VPs will be fine with it, and then the decision gets published to the company, likely in All Hands.

To understand the scale of these meetings, I posit that the Leadership Team should be, and remain at, 6-8 people. This level is where verbal discussion is most effective. Think of a dinner party. The rule is no more than eight… for a reason. (You can stretch to ten, but meetings will become drawn out.)

The VPs Meeting, by contrast, should grow as the company scales. At a company of 1,000 employees, the VPs Meeting often has 15-20 attendees. At Microsoft, this same meeting has over 150 attendees.

To give the VPs more visibility into how decisions are being made, Amazon now holds its Exec Team meetings in an auditorium. The VPs sit in stadium-seating, silently observing.

You can recreate this information flow by inviting observers to your exec meeting. There are two keys to this:

- Make explicit the status of each participant (Participant vs. Observer) and strictly enforce those roles.
- Only add Observers if you have a culture of radical candor where the Exec Team will continue to say EXACTLY what they would have without the Observers present.
