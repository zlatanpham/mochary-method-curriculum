[Drama Triangle (and 100% Responsibility)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_0_uQLGnf8gt3bQEOQhGH-bJhY_Zb62eyEl1YdfVS1s/edit)

Whenever we see a problem, we often feel some degree of anger and fear. This causes our brain to go into some level of "fight or flight" mode, which causes us to be more interested in convincing others that our solution is right, rather than getting curious about what we can learn (from others and the situation). If you believe, as I do, that better solutions come from shifting to a place of curiosity rather than wanting to be correct, the critical question then becomes: "How do I shift?"

There are many ways to do so. Below is one.

This method asks each of us to:

- First, state in starkest terms our thoughts come from wanting to be right ("below the line"). If we can express them verbally, then we can often let go of our attachment to them. This step is sometimes the only action needed to move to a productive conversation and easeful solution.
- Second, rather than look at the problem as externally-created (and therefore only externally-solvable), we state what we did to create the situation ("above the line"). This statement often highlights what we can do to solve it. Again, this second step may be enough to move to an easeful solution.
- Third, if we want to understand why we feel Fear or Anger in these situations (and then cut those feelings off at the source), we can think back deeply into our childhood to see when this pattern first appeared, as it likely appeared as a very normal response of a young child to an external stimulus. If we can see that, then we can see how that "persona" was helpful to us as a child but is no longer beneficial to us as adults now.
- Fourth, if we have shifted to a place of curiosity, we then state if we are willing to discover a resolution quickly. If the answer is yes, then we proceed.
- Fifth, discuss amongst the group, discover a solution and make agreements.

Identify issue:

##### Below the Line:

Steps:

1. "I blame (a person's name) for (an action)." Villain
2. "This negatively affects me in the following way …." Victim
3. "I temporarily solve this situation by …." Hero

Once you complete one round, go back to Step 1 and pick a different person. If Steps 2 and 3 are identical, there is no need to repeat them.

Continue going through the Steps until there is no one else to blame. Remember, you can always blame yourself.

##### Above the Line:

I created this situation by…

Questions to answer to help you take 100% responsibility:

- What do you have to be right about?
- What do you withhold, and from whom?
- What do you not face?
- What feelings do you repress/conceal?
- What do you have to believe about yourself, others, and the world?
- How do you numb yourself from the discomfort?
- What "shoulds" do you have to believe?
- What behaviors do you do or not do to keep the issue in place?
- To what do you feel entitled?
- What are you trying to control that is NOT in your control?
- What do you believe you do not have enough of?
- What either/or story do you have to hold about this issue?
- Who do you have to be better/less than?
- What agreements do you have to make and/or break with yourself or others?
- What do you have to be afraid of?

The long-standing pattern this reminds me of is…

Am I willing to now easefully and playfully discover a solution?

##### Agreements:
