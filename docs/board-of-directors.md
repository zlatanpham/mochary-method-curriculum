[Board of Directors](#heading=h.7gjhmdva542e) (4 min)

When a board of directors and a CEO function well, board members act as lieutenants to the CEO. The board also holds the CEO accountable, and if the CEO becomes dysfunctional, the board fires her and hires another. This is the proper role of an effective board. Unfortunately, most boards are not functional.

By law, C Corporations must have a board of directors, which must meet regularly to be informed about the company's operations and provide fiduciary oversight. Organizations are incorporated to shield their owners from personal liability for the debts of the company. If a corporation does not have a board of directors nor holds proper board meetings, then someone who the company has injured can sue the organization and "pierce the corporate veil," making the owners individually liable for the misdeeds of the entity. No owner wants this. Therefore board meetings have great utility in keeping you in good standing with the law and your shareholders safe from liability.

Unfortunately, that is usually where the utility of a board of directors and board meetings ends. While there may be boards that provide helpful and timely guidance to a CEO, most do not. In some cases, boards are passive and offer little help but also little pain. Unfortunately, board members are actually contentious in most cases, advising with little to no knowledge of the company or the industry and then getting frustrated (and even combative) if the CEO does not follow their advice.

As CEO, you are immersed in your company's operations at least 20 working days a month. Your board members only learn what you can share with them during the board meeting (which occurs once a month, or once a quarter, etc.). The board members, therefore, cannot possibly have the full context. Yet many feel the need to give advice. And once you give that advice, because most have large egos, they want you to follow it. If it isn't, they can often feel resentful toward the CEO, which is very dangerous.

Because boards can hire and fire the CEO, if enough board members get their feelings bruised from unfollowed advice, the CEO may find herself looking for a new job.

There are other pitfalls to a board:

1. A board with an even number of board seats (i.e., 4, 6, etc.) can have a deadlocked vote. Even if the issue is a simple one, this can cause an existential crisis if there is no way to break the deadlock.

2. A board with many board members requires lots of maintenance as board members often want to have 1-1 conversations with the CEO on major issues and be heard in the board meetings.

There are ways to avoid these pitfalls. Here are my "board best practices":

1. Keep the board to an odd number of seats and as few seats as possible. The ideal number is three. Try very hard not to go beyond five.

2. Board observers are supposed to observe only during a board meeting and not talk unless asked a direct question by a board member. Enforce this behavior.

3. Give the board members all the information they need at a board meeting (or even better, before the board meeting) in writing to have few or no questions during the meeting. The best way to do this is to:

   1. Create a complete presentation with

      1. complete financials and metrics/KPIs
      2. write-up of the good and the bad from these metrics
      3. what we accomplished since the last board meeting (OKRs)
      4. what we plan to accomplish at the next board meeting (OKRs)

   2. Significant challenges that we face, and how we plan to address them

   3. Do a test run with a trusted non-board member who asks questions where things are unclear. Answer all of their questions, and add the answers to the board presentation.

   4. Present this final version to the board, and they will likely have no further questions.

After the board presentation, where there are hopefully few to no questions:

1. Give **the board members homework**.

2. Give each one a very specific assignment.

3. Don't worry, none of them will actually do the homework.

4. But they also are then not likely to give you unsolicited advice. This is the true goal of the homework.

5. If a board member does give you advice, take notes. Summarize what the board member said, and ask if you got it right. Once they say "Yes, that's right," thank them for their advice and let them know that you will seriously consider it in formulating your go-forward plan. This will make the board member feel that you heard them, which is primarily what they are after.

The goal of the process above is to:

- Make board members feel informed and heard so that they don't make trouble for you
- Use the least amount of your time to achieve the above

If you already have an even lighter-weight process satisfying to your board members, please stick with that … and let me know what it is\!
