If you’re worried about whether you’re micromanaging, the best thing you can do is ask your direct reports about their experience with you as a manager and whether they feel you micromanage them.

Not ready to do that? As a prior micromanager myself, I usually recognize it in leaders when they:

- Are _excessively_ involved in processes, functions and decisions below their pay grade — beyond the healthy norms of management
- Struggle with trust
- Reluctant to delegate
- Are hyper-focused on the details
- Insist that something be done their way versus delegating well & [holding the team accountable](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1foUj9i_K3X-0c5WTQrggSyH93-FflNxzdlrgAUvARSQ/edit?usp=sharing)

#### **The Root of Micromanagement**

As with any behavioral change, it’s critical to first understand the underlying motivating factors that drive that behavior — consciously or unconsciously. For micromanaging, it’s:

- **A lack of trust**
  - You don’t trust others to get it done \[right\] and often check to make sure they actually did it. Plus, how productive are they really?
- **Need to control**
  - You fear/hate it when decisions are made without you, and want constant updates on progress.
- **Perfectionism**
  - You obsess over details and don’t want to delegate because they won’t do it as well as you.
- **Fear of losing power/influence**
  - You want to stay involved, so you limit others’ power/authority.
- **Lack of confidence in team members**
  - You often ignore team members’ feedback and are quick to take back work as soon as a problem arises.

Lo and behold, fear is often at the root of all of this. And you know by now that [fear and anger give bad advice.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sDWHUm6zwEGiPBQH2Ig6DDvVL-IEQSlfNeQnR2mhjmE/edit)

#### **Diminishing Returns**

The story we micromanagers tell ourselves is that “It’ll be faster if I do it” or that it’s for the greater good. But here’s the ugly truth: Leaders who micromanage…

- Burn out at a higher rate (and burn their teams out)
- Experience lower velocity, trust, candor and transparency with direct reports
- See higher turnover rates with employees and increased costs due to ongoing hiring
- Create work cultures with higher levels of stress, toxic behavior, depression, complacency, lower productivity and lower engagement

#### **Know Better, Do Better**

When I micromanaged, I thought I was helping by bringing my experience to bear to help solve whatever problem was at hand. But as a leader, I was bottlenecking my team and hampering their growth and therefore the company’s growth and success.

I leaned into figuring out what the underlying gaps were in my own communication as well as my direct reports’ skills, processes and understanding— not in the issue/problem/work itself.

By channeling my energy into supporting my people in addressing the underlying gaps in their processes, they not only solved the problem at hand; they were empowered to solve 100,000+ problems going forward\!

If you hired well, you have a strong leadership team around you, all with different strengths, skills and zones of genius from you. What's stopping you from delegating more to them? From leading in a way that helps your direct reports shine?

Not sure where to begin? First grow your awareness. Just gather information first: Where/when/why do you find yourself micromanaging?

Then, get curious about what your underlying need(s) are.

Then, ask the team to meet that need or to help come up with a better process to meet those needs.

Practice. Practice. Practice. You’ll gain confidence each time you complete a rep. I also strongly encourage you to practice mastering [delegation (slide 6\) and accountability](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1foUj9i_K3X-0c5WTQrggSyH93-FflNxzdlrgAUvARSQ/edit?usp=sharing).

Stick with it, remember why you want to be a powerful delegator and leader, and you’ll improve — often faster than you may have expected.

#### **Commit & Be Consistent**

NOT micromanaging will be hard at first. Commit to doing better, share with your team what you intend to do, ask for accountability, and embrace the suck of not being great at something for a change.

With time, you will feel the exhilaration that comes from great leadership — as well as the newfound mental and literal freedom and upward momentum you’ve created for yourself and your team.

Leadership requires a constant unfolding and letting go of prior phases and facets of our roles, especially for those of us who launched an idea into something big, moving through the ranks from founder or first employee to CEO.

Where are you getting in your own way? How are you blocking your team from growing and taking on more? If you're not sure, get quiet. Look within. Or better yet—[ask your team](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SLHeBWEXHk9SEvUKUU1hMsxl-U-IRaeZqA-wpx02lb4/edit). See what emerges. Then [let's talk](https://coach.mocharymethod.com/).
