Books:

- 15 Commitments of Conscious Leadership (start with the first 3 commitments)
- The Untethered Soul

Training:

Conscious Leadership Group. Santa Cruz, CA.

- Join a group
- Then do a [3-day intensive](https://conscious.is/events)

Byron Katie, [The Work 9 days](http://thework.com/en/ultimate-inner-adventure). Ojai, CA.

- Individual consciousness training. I have not done it, but have heard very good things.

[The Hoffman Process](https://www.hoffmaninstitute.org/). 7 days. CA. Lots of dates.

- Individual consciousness training. I have not done it, but have heard relatively good things. Because it is so widespread, there are many alumni group meetings that reinforce the habits learned, which is a huge plus.

Hendricks Institute

- The folks that trained the founders of CLG.

[Bez Stone](http://www.bezstone.com/)

- Training to reignite sexual desire in a woman (primarily for couples in long-term relationships who are no longer having sex). Loosely related to red Tantra.

[David Deida](https://deida.info/events/?tribe_paged=1&tribe_event_display=list)

- Teaching the man to fully be in the masculine persona and thus give his partner a spiritual sexual experience. Loosely related to red Tantra.

Internal Family Systems.

- [Provider directory](https://selfleadership.org/practitioners.html). Look for "Certified IFS Therapist." It works surprisingly well over video calls, so try out remote ones too.
- This is the system that MAPS uses in its clinical trials paired with the use of MDMA to treat PTSD patients. But the method is also very effective on its own (without the use of MDMA).

Tamara Andreas (tamaraandreas@q.com)

- Uses a system called [Core Transformation (1h06m, only watch 1-2 minutes to get a sense of the process)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xg-On46YcHc) Akin to consciousness, but is able to infuse it into the body making it far easier to “not get triggered”. **Highly recommended by Matt.**

GS Youngblood ([gs@gsyoungblood.com](mailto:gs@gsyoungblood.com))

- Wrote an excellent book called [The Masculine in Relationship](https://www.amazon.com/Masculine-Relationship-Blueprint-Inspiring-Devotion/dp/1699443386), which translates David Deida’s work into very easy-to-understand and easy-to-apply behaviors. He also does very effective 1-1 coaching at a reasonable rate. **Highly recommended by Matt.**

Psilocybin-assisted therapy:

- Tracy Townsend at [https://www.eleusiahealth.com](https://www.eleusiahealth.com/)

Parenting:

Patty Wipfler. She has made a huge difference in my life (and our kids’). Her book “Listen” is good, her approach very consistent with Dan Siegel’s science (he is probably the best known child development psychologist) and she also does personal coaching of both parents and children to deal with specific challenges. I have recommended her to quite a number of people and have always heard good things. patty@handinhandparenting.org. Feel free to mention my name (Bo Shao).
