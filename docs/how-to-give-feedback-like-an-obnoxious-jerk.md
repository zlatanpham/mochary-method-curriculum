As Marty McFly walked into the crowded conference room, Biff Tannen bellowed, “Hey, look everyone, Marty’s fly is down\!” Now, some may argue that Biff, while being obnoxious and aggressive, provides direct and actionable feedback.

However, to avoid being a Biff, feedback should come from a place of compassion and a genuine desire to help your colleague improve.

In ‘No Rules, Rules’, Reed Hastings & Erin Meyer reveal two superpowers that Netflix employees effectively use to give constructive feedback.

**Assist**

Give feedback to assist, not to bring someone down. An example of the latter would be providing feedback to voice frustration or furthering a political agenda. Hence why giving feedback when feeling anger and fear is a bad idea.

The goal of feedback is to help a person improve; otherwise, don’t give it.

Like my Austrian grandmother used to say, “If you ain’t got nothing nice to say, keep your Von Trapp shut.”

Feedback should be a GIFT to the person and, therefore, the company.

**Actionable**

Focus your feedback on what your colleague can improve.

When Biff gave feedback to Marty, he stopped before the most crucial part. By just yelling, “Marty’s fly is down\!” Biff’s feedback stops before it becomes actionable.

Biff would have been more effective and more compassionate if he had said in a low voice, “Marty, I am sure you will want to know… your zipper is down. I want you to know because when we are with clients, we will have a much better chance of closing the deal if we are presentable. ”

It’s not always possible to give actionable advice, but the effort to include information that can ensure the receiver is on a path to improving is critical.

Taking the time and effort to make actionable feedback shows that you genuinely care about your colleague.

Don’t be Biff.
