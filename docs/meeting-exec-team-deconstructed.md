The Exec Team meeting is a place where the top leaders in the company come together to

- Report on the status of all departments, goals, projects, etc
- Unpack and solve issues that have arisen
- Give each other feedback on behavior

When this meeting gets too large (over eight active participants), an efficient discussion is no longer possible.

(Note: it is OK to have an unlimited number of observers as long as:

- Observers indeed remain observers, i.e., they don't talk unless specifically asked to by the meeting owner.
- Active participants don't tone down their comments because observers are present.)

When the number of team leads becomes too large, most companies split into an Exec Meeting and a Team Leads Meeting, as described in [Leadership vs. Team Leads Meeting](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OAdsheOc1RAS1-FC1PMImJ_sRGfug-SPamvTpu5P5vs/edit?usp=drive_web&ouid=102503928790226855337) (3 min).

And while this structure is better than a huge meeting with way too many active participants, it does have a weakness. Updates on a project occur without the project lead present. Issues involving teams get decided on without those team leads present. How to solve this?

Francis Davidson at Sonder has figured out how: The "deconstructed" exec team meeting\!

Here is how it works: Each function of the exec team meeting receives its own meeting (every 2-4 weeks) with the most relevant eight people present.

Each company goal has its own meeting bi-weekly, with the most relevant eight people present. If the company has three goals, this is three bi-weekly meetings.

Each department has its business review monthly with the most relevant eight people present (and anyone is invited to observe). This is 6-10 monthly meetings.

Each major project has its own monthly review meeting, with the most relevant eight people present.

At each of these meetings, the participants present (in writing and video in advance, of course, see [Writing vs. Talking (and Video)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bUiRJKbZUmiFK2aWbYQtogxqrnygwFYwkLXwtnkyjFM/edit?usp=drive_web&ouid=102503928790226855337)) their wins, the status of their agreed-to actions, the issues and their proposed solutions, and their feedback for each other. Issues get decided. Feedback is processed. Actions get created.

There is no one overall Exec Team meeting. Just deconstructed sub-meetings.

Francis began this process in spring 2021\. So far, the results are promising. I will give further updates as I hear them from Francis.

Here is the complete write up from Sonder of the [Sonder Leadership Team Management System](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ugeG0NFCcwvpf_SjBB_XlByeR-3D1Mz4Ni46rjnCaeA/edit#heading=h.2sujgn98adlm).

After reading this write-up above, Francis Davidson, CEO of Sonder: "We still have a monthly all VP meeting where we review financials and summarize all decisions made in the last month. No video updates."

Sonder, Reddit, and Bolt are now using this Deconstructed Exec Team Meeting method … with great success.
