[Introductions: the double opt-in](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19FWxzeYzjqW-6l-5GsTAB5QgD2ITuW0XWeQxh_7sptg/edit) (2 min)

As your success as a CEO continues, your network will grow. Your friends will ask you for introductions. And there is no reason not to give those intros, as long as you follow introduction etiquette. Luckily this etiquette is simple. There is basically only one rule to remember: double opt-in.

When someone asks you for an introduction, they are opting in. But the receiver has not yet said they are interested. You are now at single opt-in. If, at this point, if you connect the two via email, text, etc., you will have given a single opt-in introduction.

The receiver will then be in an awkward spot. If they are not interested in connecting, they now must do one of the following:

- ignore the message, risking the appearance of being aloof (and putting at risk a positive reputation that they have likely worked hard to maintain)

- figure out a way to decline directly to the requester (whom they do not know), which requires thought and often induces fear that they will be viewed as arrogant (again risking their positive reputation)

- spend real time connecting with someone that they did not want to, taking time away from the things that they do want to spend time on (which is what most end up doing, and feeling resentment toward you)

And you are the one that put the receiver in this awkward position.

Don't worry. There is an easy solution.

Sam Altman, former President of YCombinator, makes more introductions than anyone I know. It takes him seconds. And everyone involved feels comfortable the whole way. He uses the double-opt-in. Here's what it looks like.

When someone asks Sam to make an introduction, he simply forwards the request to the receiver and writes a one-sentence explanation of why he thinks this intro might be interesting for the receiver and then writes, "Interested?" Now the receiver can choose to opt-in or not. If the receiver opts-in, double opt-in has been achieved, and Sam creates a new email (or uses the original email) to connect the two.

Conversely, If the receiver responds "not interested" to the original request, Sam simply lets the requester know that. And the requester is appreciative that Sam tried.

This process may seem slightly different from a single-opt-in, but it is a massive difference for the one on the receiving end of a request to meet. If you use double opt-in, you will have two happy participants, both of whom will be grateful to you. If you use single-opt-in, you will not.
