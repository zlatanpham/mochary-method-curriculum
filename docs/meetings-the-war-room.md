[Meetings: The War Room](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HO00SGAShILVyTfvcjKHRbLy0ol4rpNo6pVlh-r1sgE/edit)

Meetings are expensive. But they can be very effective in

- Discovering and resolving blockers
- Holding people accountable to getting actions done

The cost of each meeting is time. The time to prepare for and have the meeting, which needs to be multiplied across all participants.

The question is how often to have them, and how long to make them?

The answer depends on the frequency of blockers arising and urgency of resolving those blockers.

If a person or team is operating smoothly and is rarely encountering blockers, then meeting once every 2 weeks is usually enough to identify and resolve the few blockers that do arise.

If a person or team is newly formed, or is experiencing challenges, then a weekly cadence is usually needed to clear out the blockers with greater frequency.

And there this is the crisis moment. This is when the company, team or individual experiences an existential crisis moment. The priority becomes to understand and solve the problem as urgently as possible. For this situation, a daily meeting amongst all relevant team members is the answer.

This is called a War Room.

The cost is massive. But it is the only way that I have seen to successfully rally a team to solve a problem in the shortest amount of time.

Each meeting has only two components;

- Accountability
  - Each person reports
    - whether they got their actions from last meeting done or not
      - If not, why not. And what they will do to ensure they wonâ€™t get blocked that way again.
    - the status of their area of responsibility (green, yellow, red; the good, the not good)
    - what their next actions are to resolve the not good and push toward their goal
- Problem discovery and resolution
  - Each person declares the biggest unresolved problem they see
  - The meeting owner Identifies the most salient of these problems, picks a decision-maker who makes a decision and creates actions.
    - Each action is given a due date, assigned to one DRI, and put in an action tracker where all can see its status.
