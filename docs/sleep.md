### [Sleep](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QYbZ_g59ZveqVvkrq-796Vj3xUGq0_5kPguUEqIaY1M/edit#) (3 min)

Many CEOs that I coach find that they sleep far less now than they did before running a company. For some, that means waking up in the middle of the night thinking about an issue or a to-do. For others, that means going to sleep late (to finish emails, etc.) and then being woken up by the alarm clock to make it to their first meeting. Either way, the elusive "full night of sleep" becomes a distant memory. These CEOs feel that their bodies are wearing down, and soon they will break in some way.

If this is happening to you, here are the essential things to know:

1. This feeling is totally normal\!\!\! There is nothing wrong with you.
2. Your body is remarkably resilient. It will not break so easily. (I regularly get between 3 to 6 hours of sleep each night and am fine.)
3. Your body goes through a sleep cycle of light sleep, deep REM sleep, and lighter sleep again. These cycles usually last 1.5 hours each. What makes us feel tired and groggy is being suddenly woken from a deep sleep, and this almost only happens from an alarm clock. Curiously, we feel better rested with 6 hours of sleep (waking while we are ending a sleep cycle) than we do sleeping for 7 hours, and having an alarm wake us out of REM sleep. (For this reason, I have gone for months with 3 or 4.5 hours of sleep per night and felt just fine.) To test this phenomenon, download a SleepCycle app and use it to both track your sleep patterns and wake during light sleep. If nothing else, you will realize that what you are experiencing is common and not abnormal.
4. If you are waking with a thought about an issue or a to-do, it is because your mind is desperately trying not to forget this urgent task. To quickly quiet your mind:
   1. Keep a notepad by your bed. Write down whatever it is that you woke up thinking. In the morning, transfer it to your [GTD](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rSfwOrlTa8kcRoHIikOBVgrZRZPxq3Sm5F7Hb21TmvQ/edit?usp=drive_web&ouid=102503928790226855337) system.
   2. Faithfully follow your GTD method during the day. Write down all of your next actions, waiting-fors, etc. Your mind will not need to remember this task or issue at night, knowing that you have already recorded it in your GTD system.
5. When you do wake during the night, don't fight it. Allow yourself to do productive work. If you aren't motivated to do productive work, do something soothing, like reading from a paper book. Avoid doing something unproductive and stimulating (i.e., social media on a screen). Screens emit blue light akin to sunlight and turn the body's circadian rhythm receptors to "wake" mode. Therefore, do not turn to a screen in the middle of the night if you can at all avoid it. Enable the habit of no screens by not allowing your phone or computer to even enter your bedroom.

Remember that Benjamin Franklin famously woke up each night after several hours (probably 4.5), took a bath, wrote (which is why he was such a prolific author), and then went back to sleep for several more hours until the sun rose.

1. Experiment with your sleeping arrangement. Throw money at the problem. Here are some things that have worked for others to create a soothing sleeping environment:
   1. Sleep position
      1. Face-down with one leg raised at a 90-degree angle (Tim Feriss).
      2. On the side, with a thick pillow between the legs, a thick pillow that elevates the head until the spine is straight, and a thick pillow to hug, all on a memory-foam bed.
   2. Sleep surface
      1. Memory-foam bed
      2. Bio-mat
   3. The room
      1. No phone or screens in the bedroom
      2. Black-out shades
      3. White noise machine, or soothing music
   4. Rituals
      1. Meditate for several minutes just before going to bed (or in bed)
      2. Orgasm (yes, it helps\!)

   6. Timing
      1. Set the alarm for when to "go to sleep," not one for when to wake up.
