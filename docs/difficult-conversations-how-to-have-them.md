[Difficult Conversations: how to have them](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11pGR1sc5IlFXxXE9ve_RrvE1MVWpoYR7CxSyPL6wHQk/edit) (1 min)

“I have decided to hire a CRO and layer my VP of Sales. Now I need to tell my VP of Sales. He will likely be devastated. But I want him to stay, as he does a fine job on the sales side, just not on the marketing side. How do I deliver the message without causing him to leave?”

There will always come a moment when you have to deliver news that the recipient will not like. It will be a difficult conversation. Here’s how to have it …

#### **First,** prepare by reading the Giving Feedback section in [Feedback](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wi714sobuQP72sKXw6J_gkwkhtVh1t6--op_Pk0YPxA/edit).

#### **Second,** ask if the person is available to talk.

**_“I’d like to talk to you Sam. Is now a good time?” If not, ask “When would be a good time?”_**

#### This conversation should happen synchronously (in person, or on a video or audio call), not asynchronously. It’s important to see or hear the person’s emotional reaction to your message.

#### **Third,** when you begin the meeting, start by letting the person know that this will be a difficult conversation.

**_“This is going to be a difficult conversation. You are likely going to feel some combination of anger, fear and sadness.”_**

_Why? Because the times when we go into deepest fear and anger are when we are surprised. But if we get a warning that something negative is about to occur, we can mentally prepare just a little bit, and then the surprise and the feelings of fear and anger are not nearly as large._

#### **Fourth,** clearly state the difficult thing.

**_“I am going to hire a CRO and will ask you to report to them.”_**

Do not lead up to this. Get the punchline out first so that the person knows that this decision has already been made, and does not try to lobby you. This is … ripping the band-aid off in one stroke.

#### **Fifth,** briefly explain why.

**_“I am doing this because our customers need … “_**

This should not be a long explanation. Just 2-3 bullet points. At this point, the person listening has likely gone into some version of fear, anger or sadness. Their brain is not fully functioning, so they have a limited capacity to hear and process. Therefore, keep it short.

#### **Sixth,** ask them for their thoughts and feelings.

**_“I imagine that you are likely feeling anger, fear or sadness. I’d like to know your feelings and thoughts. Are you open to sharing them with me?”_**

The person will likely have lots of feelings and thoughts. Stating those thoughts will allow the person to release them just a bit.

#### **Seventh,** whatever they say, make them feel [Heard: how to make people feel it](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NiCEEUO2-38pIVGM7nrnpGRykbbtv2xuqLoKW50ZzLw/edit) (2 min).

**_“I think I heard you say …. Am I close?”_**

You do not need to act on their thoughts, just let them know that you understand their thoughts. That’s all. This will allow the person to let go of some of their harsher feelings. Not entirely. But enough that they likely won’t act rashly.

**Eighth,** if you are able to help the person achieve what they truly want (ie- find another great job, etc), do so.

That’s it.
