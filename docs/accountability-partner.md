In my coaching, I have found that many people (including me) simply hate doing specific tasks (usually admin) and therefore don't actually do them, causing debt. How to solve this?

The first answer is to delegate these tasks away as much as possible. But there always remain a few that are not delegatable. For those, which only we can do, we need a different strategy.

The question then is: How do we motivate ourselves to do them?

I have found that primarily extroverts (of which I am one) have this issue. And that is likely because we get energized by one of two things:

- Being around other humans
- Doing fun things

If we have to do something that isn't fun and we're alone, it is painful. But If we're in the presence of another human, then we're usually OK to do that thing which isn't fun. Who that other human is doesn't matter too much. It can be our child, our EA, or any other random person.

If your EA is available, reach out to him each time you need to do such a task and ask him to simply be there (phone, video call, or in-person are all equally effective) to keep you company. If he is unavailable (or you don't have one), try [Focusmate](https://www.focusmate.com/) for admin tasks. I have used it, and it's surprisingly effective.
