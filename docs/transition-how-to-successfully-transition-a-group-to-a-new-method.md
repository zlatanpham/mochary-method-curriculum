[Transition: How to successfully transition a group to a new method](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OlgcnKgY5AIl9IcWZJaywXHU6bg9Y8nOb-aqNNxbics/edit) (2 min)

The key to a successful transition is knowing that everyone wants to succeed and be seen as succeeding. Many people resist change because they feel fear that they will not know how to succeed using the new method, tool, technique, etc., or they feel fear around the time investment that it will take to learn to succeed.

The key is to alleviate this fear. And the easiest way to do so is to SHOW people how to succeed.

I can verbally describe to someone how to take a jump shot, but there is no explanation good enough for someone actually to translate my words into an actual good-looking jump shot. However, if I simply take a jump shot in front of someone, they can easily see what they need to do, and they can copy it remarkably well.

The same applies to all tasks.

Ideally, you show each person in a 1-1 setting so that they can practice without others seeing them until they feel that they are doing the new method correctly. Then you bring the group together and ask them to use the method as a group. This avoids the problem of someone feeling embarrassed that they haven't mastered the method while in the group setting.

But few of us have this amount of time to invest. An acceptable alternative is:

Meeting 1:

- I show the whole group in real-time how to use the tool or follow the method. If anyone has questions, I answer them.
- I ask everyone to now use the tool or follow the method while I watch. If anyone has questions, I answer them. If anyone gets stuck, I guide them to success.

Meeting 2:

- I ask everyone to use the tool or the method on their own in advance of the meeting.

Meeting 3:

- I ask those who like the tool or the method to show it to their team in the same manner.

I have experimented many times with creating detailed instructions for people to prepare on their own for the first meeting to be more efficient. So far, it has never fully worked. Some followed the instructions but had questions and were frustrated that those questions weren't answered in real-time. Others didn't prepare and then felt embarrassed that they didn't.

When someone feels frustrated or embarrassed, they often want to end the thing causing them this negative feeling, i.e., they reject the new tool or method.

Superhuman recognized this simple fact of human behavior and simply offered a human being to sit through each user's first use of the tool so that the user could feel successful on that very first use.

Please do the same for your team\!
