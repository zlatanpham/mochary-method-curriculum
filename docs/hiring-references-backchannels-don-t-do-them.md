[Hiring: References: Backchannels … don’t do them\!]()

Premise:

- A candidate’s performance during an interview process is not indicative of their future work performance.
- Reference interviews are far more effective in predicting future performance.
  - ie- How people behaved at work in the past is the best predictor of how they will perform at work in the future.
- But these references are only useful from people who worked directly with the candidate
  - ie- Managers and peers

Why Backchanneling Fails:

- It's easy to get connected to someone who worked at the same company and had indirect contact with the candidate.
- But few in backchannels have ever worked directly with the candidate as a manager or peer.

Superior Method: Top-Grading Style Reference Check

- Use a [structured approach inspired by the book \*Who\*](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Mw1bOV14woAMGV7x_RI_yjWSuUa1aDDfDgL2M8Vg7sA/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.f0urh1glpy37).
- After the candidate has passed the initial screen (where you determined that you like them, and they weren’t scared off by [Hiring: The anti-sell](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iK7OMMBbmvpzwfsumKde2tbO3MFLSSDU715-Yv3oOOA/edit?tab=t.0)), schedule a second interview called a Top-Grading interview.
- In this interview, review the candidate’s job history from school onwards. For each job, ask for the name and spelling of their direct manager. This takes roughly 20–30 minutes.
- Make sure that you collect at least 7 names. If the person has not had 7 managers, ask for the names of all the peers at one or all of their jobs, so that you have a list of more than 7 people with direct work experience with the candidate.
- You can ask other things about each job experience, but the name and spelling of their direct manager (and peers) is by far the most important information to collect.

References:

- If at the end of the full interview process, you want to move forward with the candidate, make them a verbal offer contingent on successful reference interviews.
  - “I really like you. I’d like to hire you. I am going to make you a verbal offer now that is contingent on successful reference interviews. If I made you the following offer, would you accept?”
  - Once you agree verbally on an offer, then …
  - “Now I am going to conduct the reference interviews. Can you please connect me to the following managers that have worked for … (list the managers that you choose, not those that they candidate choses).
- Talk to 3-7 former managers and/or peers.
- The candidate should do the work to get those former managers and peers to talk to you.
- If the candidate is unable to get those people to be willing to talk to you for 10 minutes, that is a red flag.
- Each of these people is someone who:
  - Has direct work experience with the candidate
  - The candidate did NOT cherry-pick
- If the reference interviews are as good as you hoped they would be, then make a final offer to the candidate (which they have already verbally accepted).

Advantages:

- Ensures direct contact with relevant references (managers).
- Reduces risk of cherry-picked references.
- Identifies red flags if candidates can't connect you with specific managers.

Outcome:

- This method secures insights from the most relevant sources, yielding accurate, unbiased reference checks. It’s proven far more effective than indirect backchannel methods.

Exception:

- The one place where it can make sense to backchannels is when you have met a candidate that you like, but you want to do a sanity check before committing your entire team to a full round of interviews. If you are able to do a quick backchannel to make sure the candidate isn’t toxic, then it can make sense to do so.
- I still question this use case, but it has marginal utility.
  - In my recruiting process, I move so fast that there isn’t time for such a backchannel. When I first meeting a candidate, if I like them, I then show my love to them instantly and invite them for a full round of interviews that same Friday (my team keeps Fridays meeting-free, so they are always available for such interviews). At the end of that day of interviews, if I am still a go, I make a verbal offer to the candidate pending reference interviews. If they accept, I do reference interviews (with the former managers and direct peers of the candidate) the following week. This is usually completed in 2-3 days. From first meeting to final offer takes less than 2 weeks. I find that this speed is a huge selling point to the top candidates. And in that process, there is no time for backchannels which have little value anyway.
