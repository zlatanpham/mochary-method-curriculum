[First 1-1 Meeting with Matt Mochary](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16Cr2PDEuZqy6YPWLKCMXEmkddE86M0AtW-kMKgA8L6A/edit?userstoinvite=matteo@eightsleep.com&actionButton=1#) (complete version)

#### First Meeting

This document is meant to make our first meeting together more effective and efficient.

Please read [On Time](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16QP9shWuJbHQYwqU4Fo7YAXzakzcBx2LTyQgc6oSgfw/edit?usp=drive_web&ouid=102503928790226855337). It takes about 3 minutes to read. Is this a habit that you want me to hold you accountable to: Yes or No? write here (It is OK to say no.)

Please read [Top Goal (CEO)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rWlx4P0Kpp4E8nFajcwDa4or_1EINv_ITTM-Ruo5XvQ/edit?usp=drive_web&ouid=102503928790226855337) or [Top Goal (investor)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1u1zhHYoBRfScvQ5jx9FqDQX9TKLgUCS6EgNa2Emmiaw/edit) It takes about 3 minutes to read. Is this a habit that you want me to hold you accountable to: Yes or No? write here (It is OK to say no.)

The coaching process: Please read [Mochary Coaching Methodology (CEO)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17AfqFdrx0lb6aYb786lY3a-17jUEoxDCRAT-BpDmh2k/edit).

For me, coaching is primarily about creating a deep personal connection, ie- becoming close friends. To that end, I want you to know about me as a human. And I want to know about you as a human. I have written up the primary superficial personal information about myself. Please read [Matt](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1p-0dzdOgupxhhYFHSKGoHCY9ugUwVbAUCdFmlcBCOQw/edit). It takes about 5 minutes to read. Now, please take no more than 5 minutes to write some personal information about yourself. Here are suggestions:

- Your age and birthday. write here
- Where you live and with whom. write here
- The name of your partner, if you have one. write here
- The name, ages and genders of your kids if you have them, and what their primary interest is. write here
- The name and type of your pets, if you have them. write here
- Who your closest 2-3 friends are (other than your partner and family). write here
- What you like to do for fun now. write here
- What you liked to do for fun when you were a kid (and actually had real time to play\!).
- Where you grew up. write here
- The names of your parents and siblings. write here

Please share with me some basics about your company:

- Current revenue, and % growth from 12 months ago. write here
- Current burn, cash in the bank, and therefore runway (months of burn remaining). write here
- Valuation and date of last round. Amount raised. Lead investor. write here
- Current key board members and/or primary investors. write here
- \# of employees. Projected \# of employees in 12 months. write here
- A copy of your pitch deck, if you have one. link here
- A copy of your most recent board packet, if you have one. link here
  - (I ask for the pitch deck and the board packet, because that is a way for me to ingest a lot of information about your company without you having to spend hours describing it to me.)

And finally, what would be a magical outcome of this coaching? Please don’t limit yourself to what you think is possible. Allow yourself to dream. If I, Matt, were truly a magician, what would I help you achieve? What is the thing that if it occurs, you actually will say to anyone who will listen: “Matt Mochary is a magician\!” (This is my primary motivation, btw.)

- write here

Now, let’s start the coaching process.

One of the fundamental tenets of my coaching is that our brains work best when they are in a state of joy/excitement and worst when they are in a state of fear/anger. (If you want more detail, see [Fear (and Anger) give bad advice](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sDWHUm6zwEGiPBQH2Ig6DDvVL-IEQSlfNeQnR2mhjmE/edit), 3 minutes.) So, let’s get into a state of joy by remembering to celebrate how good your life really is. Please write 1-2 good things that have happened recently in your ...

The Good

- Company
  - write here
- Personal life
  - write here

Now, let’s start doing some work. Looking out to the end of the upcoming quarter, what would be great outcomes (maximum of 3\!)? Please write them below. (You can write them in Goal or OKR style.) These are your ...

Next quarter goals:

- Goal1: write here
- Goal2: write here
- Goal3: write here

For each Goal (outcome), what is one action (input) that you can take (this is something that you control, ie- ask someone to meet with me; versus something that you don’t control, ie- they agree to meet with me) in the next week to significantly advance toward that Goal. Please write down 1 action for each Goal in ...

Actions to next meeting:

- Goal1
  - write here
- Goal2
  - write here
- Goal3
  - write here

Now let’s dig further. There are challenges in your life right now. Things that make you angry, or cause you to fear. What are they? For each, please write out:

- The issue. Describe what the problem is.
- What you did to help create this situation. If I wanted to get myself into the exact same position that you are in now, what steps would I have to take? This is an important question to ask to change your perspective from “the problem is caused by someone else and therefore can only be solved by someone else” to “this problem was in part caused by me, therefore there are things that I can do to unwind it”.
- Your proposed solution. If you have truly written out how you helped create the situation, then you now likely see the steps needed to back out of the situation. Either way, please write all the specific actions that you would prescribe to solve this issue. Even if you have no confidence in your solution, write it out anyway. (It is much more effective for me to react to your proposed solution, than it is for me to invent a solution for you.) For each action, please list who will do it, and by when they will do it.

The Not Good

  - Issue \#1: write here
  - What I did to help create it: write here
  - Proposed Solution: write here  

- Issue \#2: write here
- What I did to help create it: write here

- Personal Life
  - Issue: write here
  - What I did to help create it: write here
