[Engineering: How to increase speed and quality](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yL_m10CT6bIVsvSfjsCcm_Q4phMP63DDmItepDONQg0/edit) (2 min)

Your engineering team is not producing fast enough. And what they are producing is laden with bugs that need to be fixed.

How to correct this? The answer seems obvious: hire more engineers and get a VP of Engineering that knows how to actually manage them. Right?\!

Oftentimes … wrong\!

Building an application is in many ways like building a house. If a master builder assembles the foundation, floors, walls, roof, electrical, and plumbing … she will know how everything interconnects and builds things that work well together.

However, if a junior builder gets added to the team, he will be given a task (like building a wall) that needs to be reviewed, which takes the master builder's time. That review might reveal something wrong that needs to be fixed, which takes more of the master builder's time (imagine having to pull out nails and then redo the wall). This time to fix is often more than when it would have taken the master builder to build the wall itself. But, much more insidiously, the master-builder may well find the process of reviewing and fixing other people's work draining, leaving her with far less energy to create herself, and in the end, having junior team members may be net negative to overall productivity.

So, before you hire more people and add even more burden of reviewing and fixing (and now coordinating with a large team) to your master builder, talk to your master builder first. Consider the possibility that she is more effective if she doesn't have to mentor and review.

At some point, of course, you will need more than one builder. Consider, however, that senior developers whose code is clean and requires little review (and rarely any fixing) are the only ones who are net positive. While they cost 3x, they actually produce the proverbial 10x … mainly because the junior engineers produce close to net zero.

You are now likely thinking: "Matt, there just aren't enough senior engineers in the world. We'd love to hire only senior folks, but we can't find them. We need to bring on junior engineers so that we can eventually train them to be senior."

That is absolutely true. But then recognize that you are training. Create an actual training program. Do not sap the energy and time of your senior developers with this process. Have it happen off to the side, where the teachers are only those who actually derive energy from the process of teaching and mentoring.

Major League Baseball has the same issue. For that reason, they have farm teams. But you don't see the star major league player being required to mentor the minor league players. Don't ask yours to, either.
