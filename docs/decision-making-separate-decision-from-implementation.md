When we have a difficult decision to make, we often feel lost and confused. As we imagine the possible answers, none “feel good”. We can solicit feedback and opinions from others (and this can identify many different possible answers), but we still may not “know” what to do.

In this situation, we are often co-mingling the decision and the implementation. The decision itself is often clear, but the implementation likely feels painful. When we think of both together, our feeling of fear about the implementation infects our view of the decision.

To separate the two:

1. Answer **“Who do we serve primarily?”**

   1. If you are involved in a company, this is your customer.
   2. If you are involved in a fund, this is both the CEOs that you invest in and the LPs that invest in you.
   3. If you are involved in government, this is the citizens you serve.
   4. If you are involved in a family, this is the members of your family (including you).

2. Then ask yourself **“What is in the best interest of the person we serve primarily?”**

   1. This answer is the correct decision. Write it down.

3. Now think of the implementation. It will likely be difficult and painful to implement as you will perceive that it causes injury to others and yourself. You have two possible routes.

   1. Simply implement without worrying about the injury that it causes, or

   2. Look at the injury that it causes to others.

      1. **Reach out to those people and discover what really matters to them. Then think of ways to help them achieve that.**

      2. … now implement.

If this process makes sense logically, but you are finding it difficult to follow in practice, ask a co-worker, spouse or friend to be your thought partner. Share this doc with them. They will likely be able to walk you through the process successfully.

Why? Because they are not in fear about the pain of implementation. Only you are.
