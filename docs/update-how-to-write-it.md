On a regular cadence (weekly, bi-weekly or monthly), it is important to hold oneself accountable, and share this accountability with one’s team.

I find the most effective and efficient way to do is to:

- State whether or not I have done the actions that I said I would by today.

  - [Actions, how to review](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1a5s0RKKOgAY_JjTP40gwFfazjWVrfzfWz2-LFZQjB60/edit) (1 min)

- State the status of my priorities, and commit to the next actions toward each priority.
