[Feedback: Receiving: the 5 A's](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zsVOnpNayriDpzgjJUDO2n47YxO9EAXbVH2uC_Zpnms/edit) (3 min)

If you want to receive accurate, honest feedback and improve and keep your team communicating, YOU must make an effort to seek it.

Do so using the five A's:

1\. **Ask for it**: Make sure your team understands that giving you negative feedback will not be punished but cherished. It is essential to say this to them explicitly.

But that alone is not enough. You need to actively pull feedback from each person. They will be reluctant to share at first.

For them, it is an asymmetric bet in the negative direction. If you take the feedback well, you will positively change your behavior, resulting in a \+1. If, however, you accept the feedback badly, then you may become vindictive and try to destroy the person, which for them would be a negative 100\. Most rational people will not make this wager.

Therefore, you must be creative in extracting negative feedback for the first time so that you get a chance to prove that you will receive it well.

Lachy Groom recommended a feedback method that I use often. I ask the person: "Please don't say it, just think it. What is the thought you have that you are afraid to tell me because you think it will hurt my feelings? Again, please don't say it; just think about it. Do you have it in your brain chamber?" If they respond "Yes," then I say, "OK, now please say it."

I also let my reports know that I will think that they are simply withholding until they share negative feedback with me, and I won't fully trust them.

It would not be enough for me to say, "Give me feedback anytime." None of my reports would ever actually create the time and space to do so, as it feels aggressive to push for this agenda item. Instead, I must carve out this time and space. I do so in the last 5-10 minutes of every meeting, whether 1-1 or team meeting. And I do it in writing (I ask each participant to write down their feedback to me in real-time in our shared Doc) so that I can refer back to it forever. And once they do give me this negative feedback, I then create a recurring space for them to give it to me from then on. I recommend that you do the same.

Many meeting owners send a survey after the meeting asking for feedback. Please recognize that this is close to useless. Most people will not carve out the time to do so, nor be motivated to give honest feedback as they have no idea if it will be read or understood.

2\. **Acknowledge it.** Confirm that you heard it correctly by saying, **"I think I heard you say …"** Summarize what your colleague said or wrote. Put yourself in their perspective, and say it as if you are them talking to you. Then say, **"Is that right?"** If they say **"Yes,"** you can move on. If they say **"Not quite,"** ask them to repeat it until you can summarize it correctly. Once you have summarized what they said correctly, you can even go deeper by saying**, "There’s more. Please tell me more."** Keep repeating the cycle until they say, **“That’s everything.”**

If you want to go to the advanced level, also describe the emotions they are experiencing. Do this by feeling the feeling yourself and expressing the thoughts in your head if you were in their situation. Go big here. Exaggerate the thoughts. Use swear words. Remember that they fear you will get angry (and then become vindictive) if they say what they think. So they have toned down their thoughts when saying them. If you tone it down even more, they will not feel heard. But, by contrast, if you amp it up, they will likely say, "Well, it's not that extreme." But they will feel heard. And they will feel safe seeing that even though you thought they were saying the amped-up version, you didn't get angry.

Example:

1. What was said or written:

   1. _"I wish that you wouldn't act in anger."_

2. What is likely in their head:
   1. _"Goddammit, why do you always have to be such an f-ing bully? Let people talk and at least have the courtesy to not rage at the ones who are telling you what you need to hear while the others cower in silence\!"_

**Acknowledging is the single most powerful tool that I know of to create trust and connection.** People need to feel heard. And they can only know that you heard them if you say back their words (or, even better, their thoughts) to them. Oddly, this step is actually more impactful than acting on their feedback.

To confirm that you have done this correctly, ask the person: "**Do you feel heard?"**

This process is explained in more detail in [Heard: how to make people feel it](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NiCEEUO2-38pIVGM7nrnpGRykbbtv2xuqLoKW50ZzLw/edit) (3 min).

3\. **Appreciate it**. Say **"Thank you"** for the precious gift that your team is giving you. Don't make excuses. Don't argue back. Just say, "Thank you."

4\. **Accept it** (or not). Declare whether or not you accept it. You do not have to accept the feedback. If you had to accept all feedback, it would become tyranny of the feedback-giver. And we never want that.

You just need to declare whether or not you accept it. There may well be feedback that you do not accept (i.e., that you disagree with philosophically). If so, please explain why. Bring us into your world. Make us see why this feedback doesn’t make sense for you.

If you do accept it, however, then move on to step 5\.

5\. **Act on it**. Co-create an action item that will effectively address the feedback. Put a due date on it. Do it. And then let the feedback-giver know that you did the action. When you do, you will have completed the feedback loop. And the feedback-giver will then have gained trust that you want feedback and are committed to improving. Publish this feedback and action item widely to the organization. Only then will your team members feel confident that you hear their voices and that it is safe to give you further feedback.
