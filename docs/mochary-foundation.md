The [Mochary Foundation](https://www.mochary.org/) seeks to create a legitimate first chance for all Americans.

While we Americans like to believe that our country is the land of opportunity and that anyone with the will can make it economically, the reality isn't quite so clean. Many forces make it difficult (sometimes nearly impossible) for someone to battle their way out of poverty.

One of the harshest barriers is a criminal record. It costs $35 to do a background check online, and therefore nearly all employers do one. For most jobs, having a criminal background is an immediate disqualification. So, once a felon leaves prison or jail, she often cannot get a job. Yet, she must still eat. She, therefore, resorts to stealing or dealing. And the cycle of incarceration continues.

But there is an answer. Jobs that require a hard skill or license and for which there is a shortage of qualified applicants are willing to ignore criminal backgrounds. These jobs include construction (skill) and truck driving (license).

We, therefore, created [FreeWorld](https://www.joinfreeworld.com/) to help x-convicts get their Commercial Driver's License (CDL) and then a trucking job. The results have been dramatic.

In its first year, we trained 68 x-convicts (primarily in Stockton, CA) to get their license. All but one of those went on to earn a trucking job paying more than $40k/yr. Those who have entered their second year of driving are now making $60-80k/yr. And one that bought his truck is now making over $120k/yr.

It costs us about $5,000 to train each person (we call them Free Agents) to get their CDL. Once they are financially stable, we have begun asking each new Free Agent to pay back a portion of their income until they have paid for the cost of their training plus two more. The first of those payments should start arriving in 2020 and, if they continue, FreeWorld will quickly become self-funding.

In its second year, FreeWorld hopes to train 300 Free Agents and then, if all is continuing to function well, scale massively from there.
