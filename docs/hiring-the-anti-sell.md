[Hiring: The anti-sell]()

Objective:

- Attract candidates who are genuinely aligned with your company’s real work culture and demands, not an idealized version.

Common Pitfall:

- When hiring, it’s natural to highlight all the positive aspects of your company to attract candidates.
- This is a mistake. This approach attracts candidates who expect a perfect, idealized environment and will likely become dissatisfied if the reality is more demanding, or you will be dissatisfied with their unwillingness (or inability) to operate as you actually want them to.

The Anti-Sell Strategy:

- Present the Reality: During the interview, openly describe the most challenging and potentially off-putting aspects of the job and company culture (e.g., high-pressure environment, long hours).
- Result: This approach will deter the majority (98%) of candidates who aren’t a fit for the actual work environment.
- Outcome: The few candidates who remain (about 2%) are those genuinely excited about and prepared for the reality of the job.

When:

- Employ the anti-sell in the very first interview. First ask the candidate about themselves. If in the first 5-10 minutes you get the intuitive hit that you like this candidate, move to the anti-sell.
- Why? So that you find out as soon as possible if they are a real candidate, so as not to waste any of your time if they are not.
- If the candidate is still a “hell yes” after the anti-sell, then you can spend your and your team’s time in the remainder of the interview process, knowing that you will get a very high return on that time spent\!

Benefits:

- Filters candidates, selecting only those who resonate with the true demands of the role and culture.
- Reduces turnover risk by ensuring candidates understand and accept the work expectations.
- Attracts candidates who are motivated by the company’s actual environment, not by an idealized pitch.

Long-Term Effect:

- Though fewer candidates will make it through the Anti-Sell filter, those who do are likely to thrive and contribute effectively within the company.
