#### [OKRs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GoiH4pwsph5rwSM_wMMiMJkX6-qFVwO0SVYkodNZhwg/edit#) (6 min)

For your quarterly goals, or OKRs (Objectives and Key Results), the target is 3 and 3\. Three Objectives, with three Key Results for each Objective. Create these OKRs for the company, then for each department (based on the company OKRs), then for each team (based on the department OKRs), then for each individual (based on the team OKRs).

(Warning: A common mistake is to create Department OKRs, without creating Company-level OKRs. This omission leads to silo-ed fiefdoms that do not work together nor trust each other.)

The Objective (O) answers the question: "Where do we want to go?". This objective should tell a compelling story akin to the tagline of a Hollywood movie. It does not need to be measurable (i.e., ironically, it can be subjective). But it should be inspiring.

Key Results (KRs) answer the question: "How do we know that we're getting there?" KRs should be objectively measurable.

Here are examples:

**Objective:** Massively grow revenues.

Key Results-

- $500,000 MRR (Monthly Recurring Revenue) _\[metric that lets us know we've gotten to the desired result\]_
- Hire ten additional SDRs. _\[step needed to get to the result\]_
- Hire Sales Ops person to project manage the sales team. _\[action required to get to the result\]_

Company OKRs should be broad enough to encompass the whole company so that each department and team can feel that their work contributes to at least one of its priorities. Typical company-level OKRs include:

- Profits: Massively grow revenues while minimizing expense
- Product: Delight our customers
- People: Create a positive and transparent environment where we are all inspired to do our best work

#### Forming OKRs

At the end of every quarter, gather the leadership team and collaborate on the coming quarter's OKRs. I've found the process that gets the best results, and most buy-in is to ask every member of your leadership team to separately write up what they think the global OKRs of the company should be. Then combine the ideas of everyone into one document. You will see common themes and have a healthy debate about the company's priorities. But in the end, you are the Decision-Maker, and you must choose what the company's OKRs are. This is not an exercise in consensus, just in hearing people out.

The critical thing to keep in mind when forming OKRs is that they are clearly defined and measurable so a third party can adjudicate whether or not they were completed.

Once your leadership team has come up with the company's OKRs, share them with the broader team and instruct each department head to perform the same process within their department and then at the individual level during one-on-ones.

Keep in mind that each person should develop their OKRs (that align with the company's) rather than you dictating each person's OKRs. That way, each person feels personally invested in their OKRs and has 'buy-in.'

The OKR creation process is usually a distracting one. Therefore, keep it to one week or less if at all possible. Make this an Admin Week, and do all the other required quarterly admin processes (last quarter's OKR de-brief, performance management, etc.) during that same week.

Here is a potential timeline for OKR creation during Admin Week:

#### Timeline

- Monday.
  - Leadership Team meeting (with all Department Heads). 2 hours to create company OKRs using [Structured brainstorming](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zHmVPz0gVQqXctk5w2oKs8cQTLw6uprbPgQZaoO3HT0/edit#heading=h.nlpvf7hfrw7x).
- Tuesday.
  - Each department has a group meeting (2 hours) to create department OKRs. CEO to check and approve all department OKRs by the end of the day.
- Wednesday.
  - Each team has a group meeting (2 hours) to create team OKRs. Department head to check and approve all team OKRs by the end of the day.
- Thursday.
  - Each sub-team has a group meeting (2 hours) to create sub-team OKRs. The team head to check and approve all sub-team OKRs by the end of the day.
- Friday.
  - Each individual creates individual OKRs. Sub-team head to review and approve all individual OKRs by the end of the day.
- Monday.
  - At the Leadership Team meeting, the CEO checks and approves all OKRs. Announce all OKRs to the company at All Hands.

#### Tracking OKRs

Create an OKR tracking system. Either use a third-party tool (15Five, Betterworks) or create a traffic-lighted (Green, Yellow, Red) Google Sheet or Notion page. The system should show, week-by-week, which OKRs are on track (Green), slightly off-track (Yellow), and far off-track (Red). Here is an [example](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_TgYK7fHvUXWrcIhGgUeeq8OoFi0LQ6usQm3r7owZA0/edit#gid=0).

Prompt the leadership team to update the status of their OKRs (on-track, lagging, poor) as part of the one-on-one process, and ask your managers to do likewise.

All OKRs that are far off-track require that the DRI (directly responsible individual) create a written Issue/Solution to get back on track.

The above method works well for a company of fewer than 100 people. If you are over 100, you will have to tweak the process a bit.
