[Mochary Method](https://mocharymethod.com/) now has an expanding team. In addition to Matt Mochary, [Celine Teoh](https://www.notion.so/mm-coaches/Celine-Teoh-8b99082650d14a0aac06160ad8ef4848), [Faith Meyer](https://www.notion.so/mm-coaches/Faith-Meyer-7be84956b4de4ee2b7c30f441db90dc3), [Georgia Dienst](https://www.notion.so/mm-coaches/Georgia-Dienst-7f46a6dec532402b965e236450f4038c), and [Alexis d’Amecourt](https://mm-coaches.notion.site/Alexis-d-Amecourt-c166dfb8021d44428bdbae503d558f50) have joined the team, and are BETTER than Matt\! (Yes, we said it.)

[Prismaticco](https://www.prismaticco.org/) is Nina Barber's coach-founder-matching engine, which pairs you with a coach whose skills and style match your needs and wants. Her network includes many (and quite possibly all) of the top coaches. You can reach Nina at [nina@prismaticco.org](mailto:nina@prismaticco.org).

[10x CEO](https://10xceo.com/) facilitates excellent CEO forum groups. These are very focused on hard skills (practical tactics), not soft skills (understanding your emotions and those of others). For soft skills, see the groups below ...

[Conscious Leadership Group](https://conscious.is/) (CLG) is Diana Chapman and Jim Detmer's coaching group, with many trained coaches, focused on shifting out of fear/anger to curiosity, allowing individuals and teams to perform much better. They codify their work in the book [15 Commitments of Conscious Leadership](https://smile.amazon.com/15-Commitments-Conscious-Leadership-Sustainable/dp/0990976904/ref=sr_1_2?crid=398YZ0PDHA8QG&keywords=15+commitments+of+conscious+leadership&qid=1573188460&s=books&sprefix=15+commit%2Cstripbooks%2C201&sr=1-2).

[Reboot](https://www.reboot.io/) is Jerry Colonna's coaching company. It has lots of coaches. They likely don't have operational experience, but their methodology is sound, as they have been trained by Jerry.

[Torch](https://torch.io/product/?utm_campaign=Torch+2018&utm_term=%2Btorch%20%2Bcoaching&utm_medium=ppc&utm_source=adwords&hsa_src=g&hsa_ver=3&hsa_ad=378015813289&hsa_net=adwords&hsa_cam=1701790008&hsa_grp=83974378784&hsa_acc=3335311317&hsa_kw=%2Btorch%20%2Bcoaching&hsa_tgt=kwd-804948569648&hsa_mt=b&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIxe3_06615AIVD9tkCh221AUNEAAYAiAAEgKnhPD_BwE) has many coaches. Similar to Reboot.

[Betterup](https://www.betterup.co/?camp=none&utm_medium=cpc&utm_source=google&utm_campaign=AMS19+-+General+Branding&utm_term=%2Bbetterup&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIpdT256615AIVEcZkCh2tZACbEAAYASAAEgIyXPD_BwE) is coaching for rank-and-file employees.
