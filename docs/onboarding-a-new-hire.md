Every position you hire for is already being done by someone in the company right now. The current work will be stretching someone doing it, they may not be performing as well as you want them to, but they are doing it.

Any new hire does not know your company, how you do things or the team dynamics. If you ask the new hire to start the position on Day 1 without context, there is a high probability that they will fail.

Fear not; there is an easy solution.

For the first 30 days (even better is 60), ask them to shadow the person who is currently doing the job (observing all 1-1s, team meetings, and external meetings).

After 30 days (or 60), the new hire can then take over. They will now have the full context of what you were doing before and will retain valuable history. They will have strong opinions about improving things, but they will also know what valuable pieces to preserve. They are now highly likely to succeed.

When they do take over, it is critical that you also shadow them for 2-4 weeks (or as long as you can stand it, because frankly this reverse shadowing will likely be quite boring and painful for you), and give them feedback after each meeting until you realize that they are performing better in the role than you were\!\!

When reverse-shadowing, it is key to withhold your feedback until after the meeting so that you don’t interrupt the new hire’s flow. If you have the discipline to watch a recorded meeting, then an easy way to ensure that you only give feedback after the meeting is to video record the meeting, watch the recording (at 1.5x speed), and then give feedback. Personally, I do not have this discipline, so I therefore observe the live meeting and simply write down my feedback and share it immediately afterwards.

This technique can be generalized for all [Teaching / Training](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sGF4V0xFWjESabSZElwF3YienjtiLZtp81YTHe-zMpM/edit).

Another way of saying this same thing…  
_To learn about the onboarding process from a Chief of Staff’s point of view, please read: [Onboard yourself in 30 days, by Regina Gerbeaux](https://www.notion.so/chiefs-of-staff/Onboard-yourself-in-30-days-37f4e3ed3fc54069b473363a1f03f1fc)_

Everyone I coach, I recommend getting a [Chief of Staff](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-tcubUwvktoV-Ou3bB6ynk2LLwNzdT3D_p_ILreyR_A/edit#) (2 min), and almost all have. These Chiefs of Staff are usually young (\<30) and therefore relatively inexperienced. They gain the trust of the CEO, perform well, and most end up running entire departments within the company. The success rate among them is close to 100%.

My coachees also hire new executives. These folks are usually much more experienced, and on paper, much more impressive. Logic dictates that their success rate should be higher than those of the CoS role. Instead, their success rate is about 50%.

Why is this? I have concluded that it is all about onboarding. We allow the CoS to shadow the CEO for months (gaining full context) before asking them to perform. On the other hand, the executives are usually air-dropped into a live fire (without context) and asked to perform Day 1\.

I ask my CEOs, “If you could wait 30-60 days and bring your new executive success rate from 50% to 100%, would you?” They, of course, all answer, “Yes.” So, we are now implementing the above onboarding methodology.

This just started in April of 2021\. I will update you on the results over the coming months and years. I am enormously optimistic.

It is November 2021\. The results are starting to come in. They are all excellent. BioRender, Vendr, Viz, Belong, Sonder, Vendr have all done this with great success. More coming soon.

#### Feedback

From [Regina Gerbeaux](https://www.twitter.com/_rpgbx), my former Chief of Staff:

_Shadowing somewhat resonates with me as someone who went through this process with Matt. I think it was tremendously helpful to onboard by shadowing Matt’s every move. (Things rarely set in for me when I passively observe.) For someone like me, though, I know I learn better by doing versus watching._

_Therefore, I think this format (observing for 30-60-90 days) works very specific to how a company functions, but less so for mundane tasks like ordering things, scheduling internal meetings, etc., where the stakes are less high (aka Type 2 tasks or decisions.) I feel most free and like I learned the most when performing the task versus watching, especially when I already know how to do it._

_TL;DR:_

- \*Shadow for 30 days? **YES.\***
- \*Observe company-specific things to gain context? **YES.\***
- \*Observe even mundane, small tasks? **NO. Do those myself instead.\***

From Trishia Pasaquian, my EA:

_Yes, it resonates with me. Based on my experience as a new hire, shadowing is the most effective way to learn and gain context of what the company is about, what they do, and how they do it. I’m not sure about the 60 days, but 30 is good. After 30 days, Loom recordings, Notion write-ups, or Tango will do, primarily if some tasks can be taught/discussed during coworking times._

From Sydney Liu, CEO of Commaful:

_When we were hiring for our Chief of Staff role, we did paid shadowing as the final step. The final candidates shadowed me for a day and shared their notes about what they observed, learned, found exciting, and what could be improved._

_This was a great way to get a feel for what it was like to work with the person while also seeing what they absorbed, how they processed information, what they could do on the job, and how organized they were all in several action-packed hours. We were able to make an informed hire for this role based on this portion of the interview._
