Many people report to you. And, theoretically, they perform better because of it.

But you report to no one. Yes, you report to the board, but not really. You don’t share with them everything, and therefore they are not your true thought partners.

When we work together, you will report to me. If after 3 meetings, your life is better, then you will know that the Mochary methodology works. It is all captured in [Mochary Method Curriculum](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18FiJbYn53fTtPmphfdCKT2TMWH-8Y2L-MLqDk-MFV4s/edit), so feel free to use it with your team. For a more book-like presentation, see [The Great CEO Within (online)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZJZbv4J6FZ8Dnb0JuMhJxTnwl-dwqx5xl0s65DE3wO8/edit). Those who have read these docs tell us that we should make them required reading before coaching anyone. For now, though, that’s still only a suggestion.

To make our meetings more effective and efficient, we have created [Mochary Method](https://beta.companyos.app/) software. If you find the software effective, feel free to use it with your reports as well.

## Step 1: You and your CoS

You will first self-onboard onto the tool. Then we will have **an initial 1-1 meeting.**

If we create value, we will schedule **two more meetings**, ideally spaced 2 weeks apart. We will include your [Chief of Staff](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-tcubUwvktoV-Ou3bB6ynk2LLwNzdT3D_p_ILreyR_A/edit#) (as an observer) if you have one. If you don’t have one, I strongly encourage you to get one prior to us starting our coaching sessions, or appoint someone also who is very operational to observe our sessions.

Why? Because I will show you a method of managing that you will highly likely resonate with, but then highly likely want someone else to implement amongst your leadership team. So, let’s train that person from meeting 1\.

I will ask you to do pre-reads between each meeting from [Mochary Method Curriculum](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18FiJbYn53fTtPmphfdCKT2TMWH-8Y2L-MLqDk-MFV4s/edit#). You will quickly see that the majority of my coaching is asking you to read the relevant writing to the issue that you are facing. If you pre-read the writings, you will get 90% of the benefit of my coaching without ever needing to talk to me.

By the third meeting, you will know the system and software. If you feel more engaged, effective and productive because of it, then you know that the system works, and we continue coaching together. If not, we don’t.

Typical reactions to the software are:  
Meeting 1: “Why are we using this software? Let’s just use a Google Doc, it’s easier.”  
Meeting 2: “Oh, I see why this software is better than a Google Doc. Let’s keep using it.”  
Meeting 3: “This software is awesome. Can I please use this throughout my entire company.”

## Step 2: Ongoing

At this point, you and I will have likely created a deep friendship and will want to stay connected.

(If you are working with Alexis, Faith, Georgia, Matt Given, and Aly this will be a **call every two weeks**. If you are working with Matt, this will be a **monthly** call.)

And please reach out to me at any time when you are facing a challenge. Please use the tool to both write up the issue and record a video of you describing it. I will respond near-instantly, and we can talk live if needed.

## Step 3: Board feedback

Please share with me your board packets. Let’s also schedule an 80-minute session for [Board feedback with Mochary](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sPsqJVz37Gs3Fy48w57pGzAdB905OtZ4ZRCvaM2B07U/edit). Board members greatly appreciate it, and will likely feel more connected to you afterward.

## Step 4: Exec team feedback

It is critical that your team give you transparent feedback. It is highly likely that they aren’t doing so now. I will facilitate a 2-hour [Exec Team feedback with Mochary](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ypDupvtn9IaFY1yk_Y1FShJYQD_bnN7uXKvBDLKGbQE/edit) session to ensure that they know how to give you transparent feedback, and feel safe doing so.

## Alternatives

### Ad Hoc meetings

As CEO, you have hit Product Market Fit. Customers are now eagerly buying your solution, and now you are trying to scale. As hard as it was to build a solution that customers loved, scaling the business feels even harder. You are hiring people who look great on paper, but they are just not performing the way that you want them to. And you don’t know why.

You want to share these problems with someone who both understands your business and can actually help you discover solutions. A board member would be ideal, but they are also your investor. And you need to make sure that they support your next fundraising round. Will they do so if you share with them just how out of control the company currently is?

When we work together, I will be your thought-partner, without risking your ability to get your next round done. I likely understand the problems that you are facing. I have built a scaled company myself, and have coached dozens of massive successes through this process.

In fact, I already have suggestions for many of the problems that you likely are, and will, face in [Mochary Method Curriculum](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18FiJbYn53fTtPmphfdCKT2TMWH-8Y2L-MLqDk-MFV4s/edit#). If you want to see if my coaching will resonate with you, please read a few of those writings. If you want to maximize the value of my coaching, please read all of them.

Let’s jump on the phone together, and see if we can successfully unpack an issue together.

If we can, then we can continue to meet to unpack issues one at a time until you no longer feel that you and your business are on fire.

Once we get there, then you can start to “get ahead” of the business by seeing what is coming around the corner through the writings in [Coaching: preparation for meetings (for 1-1 coachees)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iH_wfoVIwW-eLtRG6GTDSPM6Nk1E40b13f87zev3f60/edit).

You can then reach out to me whenever you face a challenge or are ready to get further ahead of the business. I will respond every time. The more often you reach out, the better. So far, no one has ever outstripped my ability to respond. Let’s see if you can be the first ...

### Curriculum-based reading

My goal is to have your company create massive value. To do this, it will need a great manager of a scaled business. That person can either be you, or someone you designate. My goal is to share with you what a great manager of a scaled business does. Then you can choose whether you want to do it or delegate it.

First, we need to sync on philosophy. The fastest way to do that is to have you read and react to my writings in [Mochary Method Curriculum](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18FiJbYn53fTtPmphfdCKT2TMWH-8Y2L-MLqDk-MFV4s/edit#). To make this easier, I have arranged them in a logical flow in [Coaching: preparation for meetings (for 1-1 coachees)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iH_wfoVIwW-eLtRG6GTDSPM6Nk1E40b13f87zev3f60/edit).

- **Please make your own copy of [Coaching: preparation for meetings (for 1-1 coachees)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iH_wfoVIwW-eLtRG6GTDSPM6Nk1E40b13f87zev3f60/edit), and write your comments in it. Once you have read the docs from Meeting 1 (should take about 10 minutes), ping me. We will then jump on the phone together and discuss live.**

If you love that interaction, we continue. If you don’t, we don’t. There will be no confusion. Either our interaction will resonate deeply, or it won’t. We’ll know during the very first session.

If it does resonate and you want to continue, I will ask you to cause your team to make the first payment. You know who the right person is to make this payment, so I will ask you to be [DRIs: Directly-Responsible Individuals](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1I4jBy1XryEdknFoDCMUY93PEn0rR-oOOx6yiLSiaa38/edit) (3 min) until the first payment is made. Thereafter, my controller will be the DRI.

Then you will implement the elements that resonated with you. Before reaching out for our next meeting, you will

- **Write in our doc the results of those actions you took.**
- **Pre-read for the next meeting and write in your reactions and questions.**
- **Ping me.**

We will meet again, and continue repeating this process of you reading, pinging me and us jumping on a call together. The turnaround time is up to you. We can do 5 meetings per day if you want. I will go as fast as you want to go.

After that, we have flexibility. Our options include:

- We continue with the readings and ad hoc meetings.
- We add other team members to the readings to create shared reality with your team.
- I share my method for running 1-1 [Meetings: How to make them effective and efficient](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1m4tP-ZtTg2OkHgu8dih4qzNSXtp9zrwS5o_Blrs6_Sk/edit) (4 min)1-1s by scheduling three of them with you (and your CoS)
- I share my method for collecting and giving transparent feedback with your [Board feedback with Matt Mochary](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sPsqJVz37Gs3Fy48w57pGzAdB905OtZ4ZRCvaM2B07U/edit) (5 min)
- I share my method for collecting and giving transparent feedback with your [Exec Team feedback with Matt Mochary](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ypDupvtn9IaFY1yk_Y1FShJYQD_bnN7uXKvBDLKGbQE/edit) (6 min)
- I share my method for running [Meeting: Exec Team: Deconstructed](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vgYguZJYExc6Gi-9vx2f73N4byhA3T7e7FGpwY_DxgI/edit) (2 min) by scheduling three of them with you and a subset of your exec team (ie- GTM, EPD or Admin).
