[Motivation beyond Mission and Money](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SYtm81Ux3aI7bka0M49gx39obnW08pYgh7_EgRJ5q3w/edit)

At a certain point in the company's financial success, your senior leadership team will have made serious money, and your company mission will have been largely accomplished. What then will keep your senior team motivated to continue in the trenches with you?

Well, ask yourself: What motivates you to keep going?

There are only two basic sources of motivation in life: fear and joy. Fear is much more prevalent. It is what causes us to perceive scarcity of money, time, love, etc. At a certain amount of wealth, however, it becomes difficult to maintain this view of scarcity. Or, if someone starts to do personal consciousness work, then fear begins to melt away quickly. If joy is not present, the motivation to keep going in the job will also quickly disappear.

What is the answer?

Develop joy\! It sounds trite. Discover that which brings each person joy, that which they would do for free. Eliminate all the activities that they suffer through. The easiest way to do this is to do an [Energy Audit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HmaRdtk8R5GQtMj72Y6XhHTru5SQAiiqDfDP3qy73k4/edit) monthly until you fill the calendar with nothing but energy-creating activities.

As proof of this, I can only offer myself as an example. I have made more money than I want to spend in my lifetime. I have also done enough consciousness work to lose my sense of scarcity. So fear no longer motivates me. I have done the Energy Audit repeatedly to the point that my calendar is almost entirely "green." This means that I do only two things:

- On the weekends, I am with my family.

- During the week, I coach (which is essentially being a manager).

  - I charged nothing for what I did for many years because I didn't want to lose the filter of only doing things that bring me joy. (Money might have confused that filter. At this point, though, there is no confusion.)

    - And I do it from early morning to late at night, day after day after day. In fact, I can't get enough. I love it so much that I even bring it into my weekends and home by hosting meals at my house on weekends for my coachees.

Are you bold enough to try this approach? First with yourself. And then, if it works for you, with your leadership team?
