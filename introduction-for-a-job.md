[Introduction for a job](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ypp26ZFP1Pow7xJur7lUI615HAHetGnlWp-ySHCh-Xg/edit) (1 Min)

I have one bullet to shoot. We can use that bullet to get you an interview or to get you the job.

Here are the two scenarios:

1\. I ping the CEO (or someone else I know at the company) and get you the interview. Then you are on your own to get the job.

2\. You get the interview on your own. If you make it to the second round, you ping me, I ping the CEO (or someone else I know), and you get the job.

Which sounds better to you?
