Meetings are a necessary evil. But only a tiny part of meetings are essential (ie- need to be done synchronously). The rest actually is evil (ie- can be done asynchronously).

IMHO, there are steps to making all meetings effective and efficient:

- Assign a **Meeting Owner** to every meeting
- Determine the **Desired Outcome** for every meeting
- Determine what **Asynchronous Preparation** can be done
- **Enforce** that this asynchronous work is completed.
- **Time-box** the synchronous agenda.
- Drive to Actions. And **write down all Actions** with a DRI (Directly Responsible Individual) and due date.
- **Track** all actions in an action-tracker.
- Collect written **Feedback** on the meeting itself.

**Meeting Owner**

Without a Meeting Owner, there will be a tragedy of the commons. Unless one person is responsible for making them happen, all of the other necessary ingredients of a successful meeting will not occur, as no one will feel authorized to grab the ball.

Here is a cheat sheet for the Meeting Owner: [Meeting guidance sheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TKZ1wW39_WxVTLtGUeQHwxzs22XobkQSri9Zr4b5zcg/edit) (1 min)

**Desired Outcome**

What is the actual purpose of this meeting? This should be clearly stated and written down. At the end of each meeting, each participant should state (in writing) whether the purpose was achieved.

Most meetings don't declare a purpose, and therefore become arenas for people to hear themselves talk. I call those … Board Meetings.

**Asynchronous Preparation**

Much of a meeting can be done asynchronously. Any status update, declaration of an issue to be solved, pipeline to be reviewed … can all be written and shared in advance, allowing others to read and comment on them even before the meeting begins.

**Enforcement**

While it is true that much of the meeting prep can be done asynchronously, that doesn't mean that everyone will do it. This is where the Meeting Owner creates value: enforcement. My preferred process is to show people how to do things in a group setting before asking them to do it on their own in advance. Here's what I mean …

- Meeting 1: (usually 2 hours)

  - Prior to meeting

    - Nothing

  - During meeting
    - First 15 minutes, I show my own written update (ie- the example). Then I ask everyone to write their updates silently.
    - Second 15 minutes, I ask everyone to read each other's updates and write in comments.
    - Then, we begin the synchronous part of the meeting.

- Meeting 2: (usually 1.5 hours)

  - Prior to meeting

    - I ask all to pre-write their updates and submit them before the meeting.
      - For those who have difficulty finding time to do pre-writes on their own, I schedule a 15-minute pre-meeting (just before the meeting) when they can do their pre-write.

  - Pre-meeting

    - I schedule 15 minutes before the meeting for those who didn't get a chance to pre-write or pre-write then.

  - During meeting
    - First 15 minutes, I ask everyone to read each other's updates and write in comments.
    - Then, we begin the synchronous part of the meeting.

- Meeting 3: (usually 50 minutes or less)

  - Prior to meeting

    - I ask all to pre-write their updates and submit them 24 hours before the meeting.
    - I ask all to pre-read and pre-comment on each other's updates.

  - During meeting
    - We begin the synchronous part of the meeting.

If there is someone in the group who has difficulty pre-writing 24 hours before the meeting, I don't shame them. Instead, we move back to Meeting 2 format. This stage is where most teams end up.

**Time-box**

Certain things must be done synchronously.

- Personal connection.
  - If a team is fully remote, then informal chat about personal lives rarely happens. I like to build in 5 minutes of this in a hyper-efficient way by asking each participant to take 30 seconds to share a highlight from their personal lives.
    - Without this step or something like it, teams will lose personal connection and trust over time.

- Issue.

  - When someone presents an Issue, I want to hear them describe it verbally so that I can know what emotion they are experiencing (fear, anger, joy, excitement, etc.), as I am likely to trust their Proposed Solution much more if they are experiencing the positive emotions that lead to brain activity in the pre-frontal cortex.

      - [Fear and Anger give bad advice](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sDWHUm6zwEGiPBQH2Ig6DDvVL-IEQSlfNeQnR2mhjmE/edit) (3 min)

  - As Decision-Maker, I want to ask questions of those who made comments that didn't agree 100% with the Proposed Solution. (This ensures that all commenters feel heard.)

- Critical feedback.
  - While we give it as a gift, it is not always received that way. I want to know how it is received in real-time so that if the recipient gets triggered I can jump in and declare that I did not intend to anger them.

So, we do these things synchronously, but we don't let them last forever. Instead, we time-box each item.

For Issues, I give them 5-20 minutes of verbal discussion depending on their importance. If a clear-cut decision cannot be made in that time, I ask the Decision-Maker to declare what further information they need, assign people to get that information, and then declare a new date/time when we can digest it and make a decision made.

For Critical Feedback, I usually give five minutes per presenter. If we are doing paired feedback, I give that ten minutes. If we are doing hot seat feedback (everyone providing feedback to one person), I give that five minutes per presenter. For this reason, I prefer Paired Feedback as we can get feedback to everyone in the room (even if there are 20 people) in just 10 minutes.

**Write down all Actions**

This step is where most meetings fail. People are so relieved to have gotten to a decision on Issues that they fail to take the final step of writing down every Action, assigning each action to one person (people can work collaboratively, but there must be one person who reports whether the Action got done or not) and a due date. Make sure your Meeting Owner completes this final step. It is the difference-maker.

**Tracker**

Once actions get written down, track them (in ClickUp, Monday, Asana, a Google Sheet, or Notion). Then in future meetings, check this tracker. This step will remind everyone of their Actions and give all the confidence that they are being done.

If you don't have an Action-Tracker and question the need for one, please read [Agreement-Tracker: why you need one](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QzGvP6MrmlD6YVilTiNjEsPgRRvjzvWrqGXKSz_c68k/edit) (3 min).

**Feedback**

Every meeting I have, whether 1-1, Team or Board, I always ask for written feedback. It usually takes 2-3 minutes to give. I make it the very last agenda item so that people can leave as soon as they finish writing.

Giving this feedback makes people feel heard, which gets them to fully participate in future meetings. It also gives me valuable advice on how to make the meeting better.

If I don't ask for feedback, people don't give it. They still have thoughts about improving the meeting, but they withhold those thoughts and then build up resentment toward me. Asking for feedback instantly bleeds off that resentment.

---

The pushback that I get on asynchronous prep is: "This takes a long time to do. Isn't this just making the meeting longer?"

My answer is:

"No. While the prep does take a while, the other participants' ability to ingest the material goes up by 5x, making the synchronous meeting itself that much shorter and the quality of the outcome that much greater. Written prep also ensures that everyone has a voice, not just those who are bold. This awareness creates buy-in and boosts morale significantly.

If async prep is too hard to enforce, stick with a Meeting 1 format, where people write and read in real-time during the meeting. That is far more effective than verbal only."
