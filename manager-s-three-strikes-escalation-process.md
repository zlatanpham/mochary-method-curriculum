Many first time leaders/managers often find themselves in a position where they’re incredibly frustrated by a direct report’s underperformance. These leaders often unknowingly fall into a “failure of management” trap because they’re not equipped with a process to hold their direct report accountable effectively.

Most leaders in this position may address the problem at some point — often far too late in the game when it feels unbearable and unchangeable. Or, they find themselves in a thought loop over what to do, which only eats up headspace and heightens feelings of ineffectiveness.

Good news: Even the most conflict-avoidant leader can avoid falling into this trap by following the below process:

#### **The Three Strike Process**

- **First Occurrence — Acknowledge what happened and GET CURIOUS first**.

  - Acknowledge: Name specific recent example/behavior.

    - Get curious: “Can you help me understand what happened here…?”
    - Once you understand, reiterate the expectation/what you’d like to see instead.
    - “Okay, we see how we got here & what needs to be done instead. **What do you intend to do differently going forward so this doesn’t happen again?”**
    - Make a plan together.
    - Hold them accountable — “Did you do it?”

  - **Second time — Acknowledge the recurrence and up the intensity a little.**

    - Start by saying something like, “X is happening again. We’ve talked about it before — can you please help me understand why this is still occurring?”
    - Make a plan together.
    - Give them a WARNING: This is becoming a pattern. It’s not okay. It’s really important to me and for your success here that we stop this from happening going forward.
    - Hold them accountable — Did they do it?

  - **Third time — Acknowledge the recurrence, and ensure they understand the consequences/severity of the issue. “If this doesn’t change, your job is at risk.”**
    - Make a plan together.
    - Hold them accountable. If they don’t fix it, they’re out.
