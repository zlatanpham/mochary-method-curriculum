[Actions: how to review](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1a5s0RKKOgAY_JjTP40gwFfazjWVrfzfWz2-LFZQjB60/edit) (1 min)

The intention of reviewing Actions is to:

- Make sure that each person has done what they said they would do and to  

- Help each person figure out how to unblock themselves on actions that they wish they had done but didn’t.

Said another way, the intention is help each person create a system that allows them to consistently complete their priority actions.

When actions don’t get done, it is not a failure. It is rather an opportunity to strengthen the system by fixing the blockage that arose.

Here’s how to do it:

For each Action that you have declared that would do by today’s date, please write out the following:

Is the action **DONE** or **NOT DONE**?

If DONE, are there any key learnings to remember, or next actions to take? If yes, please declare those.

If NOT DONE, please answer …

- **What blocked you from doing this action?**  

- **Do you still want to do this action? If yes, by what date?**  

- **What will you do now to make sure that you don’t get blocked in the same way again?** (Please write this as a separate action with a due date.)

---

Template:

- **DONE**
  - Any key learnings or next actions?
- **NOT DONE**
  - What blocked you?
  - Do you still want to do the action? If yes, by when?
  - What will you do to not get blocked the same way again?
