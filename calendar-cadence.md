Paul Graham of YCombinator, famously points out that makers (engineers) need long stretches of uninterrupted time to be productive, whereas managers are most effective when meeting. The compromise is to schedule days when no meetings are allowed.

The thoughts below are to protect those who can only produce their best work when in a flow state, knowing that any distraction destroys a flow state. This guidance applies to engineers and designers. It likely does NOT apply to people in more operational roles.

By scheduling all internal meetings (1-1s, Team Meeting, and All Hands) on a single day, you also get two massive benefits:

- You can use each 1-1 during the day as preparation for the Team Meeting at the end of the day. This action creates a super-high-quality and informed Team Meeting that causes each team member to be inspired by their peers (who are so well prepared).

- You learn about issues from each person's perspective at the same moment in time (same day), and therefore can get an accurate 360-degree view and resolve it most effectively.

The schedule that works best for a five-day workweek is:

- One day of internal meetings for the Exec Team (1-1s, Team Meeting, and All Hands)
  - A separate day of internal meetings for each Department
  - A separate day of internal meetings for each Team
- One day of external meetings (i.e., interviewing candidates)
- Three days of no meetings (with Slack off\!)

It isn't critical when these days are, although it helps to space the two meeting days apart from each other.

The above schedule often comes under fire from recruiters, who worry that:

1. It won't be easy to conduct all onsite interviews on a single day.
2. Many qualified candidates won't be able to make it in on the appointed day.

First, your hire and close rate for candidates should be very high (approx. 75%)— otherwise, you are losing incredible amounts of time by doing all-day in-person interviews with many candidates you don't want to hire or don't want to work for you. Therefore, unless you are already hitting the 75% metric, you should start screening candidates more effectively (i.e., brutally) in your phone interviews and lower the number of in-person interviews.

Second, it is true that some candidates can only come on specific days or times. However, the benefits of having meetings on only one set day, as measured by the company's increased productivity, far outweigh the cost of losing out on a few candidates. Additionally, if the candidate cannot find the time to make it on a set day within two or three weeks, it is quite likely that they won't take the job anyway.

There are many other high-level candidates out there. You can find another one. But there are only a finite number of productive work hours within the company. Once lost, there is no way to recapture them.

There are two exceptions to the advice above:

1. In the very early days of a company, when a department has just one person. At that stage, the department lead can set a recruiting schedule that works for her as she builds her team.

2. Departments that are entirely non-technical and don't require focused work time (i.e., Operations) or whose job it is to have external meetings (i.e., Sales).

The guidelines above are for when a team is already in place, which requires uninterrupted days for its work. This setup is particularly important for the Engineering team.
