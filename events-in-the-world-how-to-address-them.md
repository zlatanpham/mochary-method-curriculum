[Events in the world: how to address them?](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dyB9a9CQJ76eBPu1VeZZzR3vmLbTzwbra8wvb1-8LzE/edit)

A mass shooting where children are killed.  
A Supreme Court decision that curtails the rights of individuals, or restricts the ability of states to limit deadly weapons.  
A militia commits genocide.

Events like these occur in the world on a regular basis. For many they are tragic and cause or augment a feeling of distress and despair.

When a person feels sadness, the healthiest thing for them to do is to release the emotion by feeling it all the way through. [Sadness: how to process it](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jyTa5H_fo9xL-EhUQGsqQkUAqG4zVxAok0JwNCjiBFU/edit).

This process is often aided by someone being willing to listen and making the person feel [Heard: how to make people feel it](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NiCEEUO2-38pIVGM7nrnpGRykbbtv2xuqLoKW50ZzLw/edit) (2 min).

As a company, I recommend that you adopt a policy of helping people process their sadness, anger or fear when they feel it. But many managers will not get energy from doing it, nor do they feel that they have the time. No problem.

You can offer access to a therapist who will. There are now excellent and reasonably-priced therapy apps available. Let people know about them. You can even offer to cover them as part of your health benefits.

When an external event occurs that feels big, you can take it as a moment to remind your team that you encourage them to process their feelings, and remind of the resources available for them to do so.

But in your message to the team, please do not fall into the trap of raging at the world yourself or taking a political stance.

There is a deeper reality that is not worth sharing with anyone until they are ready to hear it â€¦

The world simply exists. It does not cause us to be sad, fearful or angry. Instead we cause ourselves to feel this way. Releasing those emotions will get us back to joy and excitement. Recognizing that the world simply is will help us not make ourselves feel sadness, fear or anger in the first place.
