[Mochary coaching (CEO with Matt), expanding the Method into your company](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11fT9G4pmJpUafyPT6oDIYozI3wj_tY8lqQP14dETI3I/edit)

You are already coaching with Matt: [Mochary coaching (CEO with Matt)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VI0SniMG32Yla8VXgMFPivLM0pwQIcRCi2VuC2ip6NM/edit)

You have had 3 meetings with him and determined that the Method makes you more effective. You now likely want to:

- Use it in your own 1-1s
- See how the Method works in a team setting
- If the Method works well in a team setting, get rid of your 1-1s altogether\!\!

You can. Here’s how:

## Step 1: Getting your team to buy in

Rather than force this Method upon your team (which they will likely resist), I recommend that you allow them to experience the Method exactly as you did: through 3 coaching sessions from a Mochary Method coach, so that your exec team members will come to the same conclusion as you did on their own: “I want for us to use this Method\!”

To do that, you offer exec coaching to each of your execs. Once each team member has had 3 coaching sessions (every 2 weeks, so reaching the 3rd session within 6 weeks of starting), you ask them if they find value in it. If yes, then …

## Step 2: Your 1-1s

Now that your reports want to use the Method, you can start to use it in your 1-1s. A Mochary Method coach will shadow your first few 1-1s to help you through the process.

## Step 3: Small team

Now that you have upgraded your 1-1s, you’ll likely want to see what the Method looks like in a team setting.

A Mochary Method coach will facilitate 3 team meetings of your closest 2-3 reports (or a sub-group like EPD or GTM). You will be the decision-maker on all issues.

We will schedule **3 meetings of the small team**, ideally spaced 2-4 weeks apart. Each meeting will be 2 hours.

## Step 4: Exec team

You will now likely want to spread the Method to your entire exec team.

A Mochary Method coach will facilitate 3 team meetings of your entire exec team. You will be the decision-maker on all issues.

We will schedule **3 meetings of the exec team**, ideally spaced 2-4 weeks apart. Each meeting will be 2 hours.

## Step 5: Get rid of 1-1s

Instead of doing 1-1s, you can now simply do all of your 1-1s in a group meeting. This saves you a tremendous amount of time, and gives your team the same full context that you have.

## Step 6: All managers

Now that you have seen how exec team management works, you’ll likely want to spread it to all of your teams.

A Mochary Method coach (not Matt) will show your managers how to manage their reports and team in the way that Matt has done with you in **3 sessions of 2 hours eac**h with an unlimited number of attendees.

## Step 7: All team members

Now that you have spread the method to all of your managers, you’ll likely want to spread it to all of your team members.

A Mochary Method coach (not Matt) will show your employees how to operate in **3 sessions of 2 hours each** with an unlimited number of attendees.

## How much does it cost?

- Implementing the Method (by a Mochary Method coach) and use of Defacto:

  - **$12,500 per month**.
  - For the company:
    - Mochary Method coach meeting 3 times with each exec team member, bi-weekly
    - Mochary Method coach facilitating 3 small group meetings, bi-weekly
    - Mochary Method coach facilitating 3 full exec team meetings, weekly or bi-weekly
    - Mochary Method coach runs 3 manager training sessions (unlimited participants), weekly or bi-weekly
    - Mochary Method coach runs 3 individual training sessions (unlimited participants), weekly or bi-weekly
    - Use of Defacto for up to 125 seats.
      - Additional seats are $100/user/month.
  - For you (the CEO):
    - Mochary Method coach shadowing 3 of your 1-1s
    - Ongoing monthly CEO forum meetings with Matt.
    - Unlimited async access to Matt through Defacto.

- Continued 1-1 monthly coaching with Matt
  - **$12,500 per month**.
  - I do not recommend paying for this ongoing 1-1 coaching with Matt. You don’t need it.
    - You are already part of a monthly CEO forum. And have unlimited async access to Matt. That is all the coaching you need.
    - Plus implementing the Method and Defacto in your company is going to improve productivity at your company so significantly that you won’t have major unsolvable issues continually arising.
    - Matt AI in Defacto is every bit as good as Matt himself.
    - The observer in your first 3 coaching sessions with Matt is now likely every bit as good as Matt himself.

## Do I fit the profile of a coachee?

Yes, if …

- You are the CEO.

- You have pain\!
  - Have achieved PMF and are now scaling.
  - Team of \>50.
  - This is the first time you've ever managed a team this large.
  - You don't have a good way to create alignment, accountability and velocity throughout your company.
  - You've hired a lot of great people, but you don't know exactly what they're doing, so you're not sure if they are intending to do the most important things, nor if they are doing what they said they would, nor how fast they are doing them.  

- You are a fan\!
  - You are a fan of Mochary Method and want to see how Matt Mochary himself would implement it in the company.
  - So eager to see this, that you’re willing to use beta software with no QA testing and no sandbox, where code pushes (and bugs\!) are introduced daily. You become the QA tester\!
  - In the Americas time zone.  

- You have the money\!
  - In such dire need, that you would gladly pay $12,500 per month to create alignment, accountability and velocity throughout your company.
  - More than $50mm cash in the bank, or over $10mm in annualized profits.

Other options:

**Board feedback**

- Please share with me your board packets. Let’s also schedule an 80-minute session for [Board feedback with Mochary](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sPsqJVz37Gs3Fy48w57pGzAdB905OtZ4ZRCvaM2B07U/edit). Board members greatly appreciate it, and will likely feel more connected to you afterward.

**Exec team feedback**

- It is critical that your team give you transparent feedback. It is highly likely that they aren’t doing so now. I will facilitate a 2-hour [Exec Team feedback with Mochary](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ypDupvtn9IaFY1yk_Y1FShJYQD_bnN7uXKvBDLKGbQE/edit) session to ensure that they know how to give you transparent feedback, and feel safe doing so.
