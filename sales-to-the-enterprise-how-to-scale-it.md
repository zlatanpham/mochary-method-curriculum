[Sales to the Enterprise: how to scale it](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1A2k-9EsxC4sn24y5lAwlO8dPqpXnCKTA1BrhSt4FINU/edit) (1 min)

You’ve built a product for enterprises (B2B). As founder, you have been able to sell the product. Now you’ve hired several salespeople, but one or all of them have not yet closed a deal on their own. And they don’t seem capable of doing so. What to do?

No need to worry. Like most business problems, this one has been solved many times before. Here is one way …

Selling to the enterprise is a complex process. It requires understanding the customer and their problem as well as your solution and its applications. Some of this can be documented in writing (and therefore learned by new salespeople in a traditional onboarding process), but not all of it. To understand the entire process, new salespeople must …

- Shadow another successful salesperson (ie- at first, that is you, the CEO) going through the entire sales process from start to finish

- Document what they saw

- Have the successful salesperson reverse shadow the new salesperson and give them feedback … until the new salesperson both succeeds (ie- by making a sale) and is approved by the successful salesperson (this is a higher bar than making one sale)

  - This is usually painful for the successful salesperson to do. They often don’t want to “waste” their time this way. Unfortunately, this is a crucial step and must be done.

- Teach another new salesperson the entire process using the previous 3 steps

As CEO, you will have to train the first hired salesperson this way. Then they have to train the next few salespeople this way. Etc.
