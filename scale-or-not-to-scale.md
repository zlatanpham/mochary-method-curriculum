[Scale or not to Scale?](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YEH0EWZOXu0nptlOCXM9etBiLVO2qDWuS_JIwK7go9w/edit) (2 min)

If you are a startup in Silicon Valley and have discovered a large potential market, you will raise significant capital early. This will allow you to hire many people. Investors may well pressure you to do so to "win the race to market share." Resist this pressure. It is misplaced.

Startups don't usually fail because they grow too late. They typically fail because they grow too early (i.e., before achieving Product Market Fit).

### Product-Market Fit

What is Product-Market Fit? I define it as having created a product that customers are finding so much value in that they are willing to buy it (after their test phase) and recommend it. Metrics that show whether PMF has been achieved include: revenue, renewal rates, NPS (net promoter score).

The company's first goal should be to achieve real PMF, not metrics that fool people inside and outside the company that PMF has been achieved.

For a B2B company, know that enterprise customers have budgets just for testing new technology and will buy your product to do just that. This does not mean that you have achieved PMF. For these types of customers, only long-term contracts are an indication that they value your product and want to use it.

There is no magic metric, but for a B2B company, it's hard to imagine PMF at anything less than $1mm ARR.

### Scaling

Once you have achieved Product-Market Fit, that is the right time to blitz scale and win the race to market share. To do this, you will need to create massive awareness (Marketing), walk many customers through the sales process (Sales), hold those customers hands as they set up and use your product or service (Customer Success), harden your infrastructure to withstand many users at once (DevOps), get rid of technical debt as well as add all the features promised in your roadmap (Engineering), update the product roadmap to meet the most urgent needs of your customers (Product), and all of the non-technical operations (People \[Recruiting, Training, and HR\], Finance, Legal, Office). All of this requires hiring talented and experienced people to fulfill those functions. First, raise the money needed to hire this team, and then begin hiring.

Once you bring on remote workers and your team scales beyond 15-20 people, most likely, things will begin to fall apart. You will hire very talented people, and they simply won't perform in the way you hope or expect. You will end up doing more and more work yourself, working longer and longer hours, just to keep the company afloat. You will extrapolate this trend and realize that soon you will break.

It is at that moment that you need to implement a formal management system. It will be painful. You will no longer be able to just "work on the product." You and your team will likely have to spend one full day per week preparing for and participating in team and one-on-one meetings. These meetings and this system will feel like pure overhead. They are. And without them, your company will never scale successfully.

The good news is that the same system that allows your company to operate well with 25 people will also work well with 25,000. Neither the system nor the amount of overhead will change. It is a one-time hit.

The rest of this book walks through the implementation of such a system.
