[Restoration and Creativity: how to achieve them](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SUU3WVCsXKBLx0IUZoz9K939khuDV5VUD7grBgJ5Wis/edit) (3 min)

Most CEOs that I coach, when I first meet them, are working 14 hour days. If they have a spouse and children, they then spend another few hours connecting with them. The rest of the time, they sleep but never enough.

The obvious cost of this lifestyle is that it leaves little if any time for the brain to turn off and restore.

The unobvious cost is that the brain is not fully creative (or creative at all) when it has no time to be distraction-free.

All CEOs need mental rest. And all of them need to be creative to envision (and document) the future of their product or service.

So, how do you get mental rest and become creative while also working 14 hours a day?

The answer is: **find ways to get bored.** Small ways and big ways.

Let me explain.

We are naturally in a mentally restorative and creative state until we introduce distractions. And modern life is nothing but distractions, both work and pleasure. On the work side: responding to messages, being in meetings, etc. On the pleasure side: watching videos or social media posts. All give us small hits of adrenaline, which temporarily feel good. But they also put our brains in alert status (amygdala) to see what comes next, with no capacity for creative thought. And the constant adrenaline doesn't allow our minds to rest and restore.

When we remove these distractions, we at first feel bored (for some people this feeling is almost unbearable). But if we allow ourselves to sit with this state and simply let it be, then eventually we start to feel a sense of mental relaxation. And then our creative thoughts begin to flow.

To achieve this state, we truly need to experience NO DISTRACTIONS. That means turning off all sources of distraction. Certainly all electronic sources (Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Tik Tok, etc.). As well as all inbound requests for information: email, text, Slack, WhatsApp, etc.

You can do this for a few minutes (whenever you use the restroom), 30-60 minutes (when you have a meal), two days (the weekend), or a week (a restorative vacation or staycation).

All of these have value. The key to each is allowing yourself to get bored. And in the beginning, you won't enjoy it. You are physically addicted to distraction and the adrenaline that it delivers. Give yourself time to get unaddicted. On the other side, you will find restoration and creativity.

Start with something small. Simply delete your social media apps, and commit to putting your phone away (in another room) whenever you are using the restroom, eating, or drinking. During that time, simply sit with your thoughts. Take your food and beverages outside if you can (to eliminate further the distraction of seeing your workspace). Stare at the leaves swaying in the wind while you eat and drink.

Try this for 30 days. It is a low-cost experiment, as you aren't getting real work done when eating, drinking, and using the restroom anyway. See if you feel more or less restored and creative than you did in the previous 30 days.

If you feel more so, then step up your experimentation and try longer stints distraction-free. Try an entire weekend disconnected. If that feels good (and it will\!), then schedule an entire week disconnected. And if that feels good, then make all of this a regular practice. Put it on your calendar.

- All meals entirely disconnected.
- One weekend a month entirely disconnected.
- One week a quarter entirely disconnected.

That investment alone will reap huge rewards for your mental peace and the company's ability to see the future.

This works for artistic creativity as well. I once coached a well-known musician. He came to me because he needed to write the songs for his new album, but no creativity would flow. He would go into the studio each afternoon after a day of meetings and responding to emails. He couldn't quiet his mind from the day's activities, so he started taking a few stiff drinks. This action calmed his mind a bit, but not enough. And the drinks were starting to take a toll on his body. What to do?

The answer: we simply applied the philosophy above. We arranged for him to rent a studio in another part of the country (where no one would know where to find him) for ten days, turn off all messaging and entertainment apps, have with him only the key people he needed to function (i.e., to get food and drink, collaborate on the music production, etc.), no drugs or alcohol, and allow himself to simply get bored.

He called me after the ten days and said: "Matt, it was incredible. I was more creative than I've ever been. I wrote and recorded the best songs of my life, and I know this album will be a huge hit. I cannot thank you enough. In hindsight, it makes so much sense. Every artist should be doing this."

The album has now been released. It is indeed a hit.

Matteo Franceschetti, CEO of EightSleep:

“This is a game-changer. I call it Stillness. I just sit doing nothing and let my monkey mind go everywhere. At the beginning the monkey is crazy. Then the monkey starts slowing down, and clarity comes. When I am on vacation, I make sure to do Stillness at least 1 hour per day. Stillness is the vacation. And now I am forcing myself to do at least 10 minutes per day when I am working. In the first minutes, I keep moving my arm to grab my phone. But eventually my mind stills, and I feel peace. It is a game-changer.”
