Once a quarter, the leadership team (and eventually the entire company), which consists of all the department heads, should take two days to:

Day 1

- Bond. Get to know and like each other as human beings.
  - Structured activities
    - Collect superficial [personal information](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Nd_ps8ibEYAFA3cqmW9UQKREC1YxEEHKz7PyouggCW4/edit#gid=0) (to generate more interesting personal conversations)
    - [Icebreakers](https://www.icebreakers.ws/)
    - Feedback to the CEO
      - Use the feedback exercise shared in [Exec Team feedback with Matt Mochary](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ypDupvtn9IaFY1yk_Y1FShJYQD_bnN7uXKvBDLKGbQE/edit) (6 min)
        - [Feedback: Receiving: the 5 A’s](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zsVOnpNayriDpzgjJUDO2n47YxO9EAXbVH2uC_Zpnms/edit) (3 min)
    - [Peer Feedback 1-1 (paired)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16iXM6T45R5cxPR_OT3hA8iumqNV9fhjNLphsfSCWo1A/edit)
    - [Trust, Deep](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IB7YDr_trYKavL_RdWTb8ddJt77eqDH_6H5BsK416FM/edit) (2 min). "If you really knew me."
  - Unstructured activities
    - Drinks at the bar
    - Sports, crafts, activities, etc.
    - Board games: mafia, codenames
    - Events where spouses are invited.

Day 2

- The Past. Do a retrospective on the prior quarter
  - How did we do against our OKRs and KPIs?
  - How did we function as a team?
  - Unpack Issues that are too emotional or strategic to solve in the regular Exec Meeting.
- The Future. Plan for the future quarter
  - Refresh Mission, Vision (including Moat), and Values
    - [Mission, Vision, Values: How to create them](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1L6ks72TkBIlgPDh6_n-NBBE7e_7nQ2YZ6B4BF12IQEs/edit)
  - Set the new company [OKRs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GoiH4pwsph5rwSM_wMMiMJkX6-qFVwO0SVYkodNZhwg/edit) (which then will cascade to Departments, Teams, and Individuals).
  - Refresh the company KPIs (which then will cascade to Departments, Teams, and Individuals).
- Refresh the company's Product Roadmap, GTM Plan, and Hiring Plan.

I recommend scheduling these offsites on a Thursday/Friday so that you can then offer an optional weekend unstructured event with spouses. Often, team members would like to get to know each other, but they are waiting for you to organize the events that will allow them to do so.
