[Hiring Execs: External vs Internal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gaknANyT2UJC0YMF6zYnErMp4imlslDbPmg-d9yeGlI/edit) (2 min)

As a company hits PMF (Product Market Fit) and begins to scale quickly, there is tremendous pressure to hire "real execs" to run each major department. By now, the dangers of hiring overqualified people into these roles are well-documented. The conventional wisdom is that you want to hire people who match the role's requirements for the next 12-18 months, not the period beyond that, as suggested by [Elad Gil](http://growth.eladgil.com/book/chapter-4-building-the-executive-team/hiring-executives/). But I want to introduce a far-more-radical and far-less-popular view:

Hiring externally is a failure of training\! Executives are nothing more than managers of managers. And there is only one set of training that every manager needs to become an exec: How to manage well. In addition, there is a massive benefit from providing this training internally: all of your execs and managers will use a similar management system, and therefore the company as a whole will operate as one unified team, rather than disparate teams tied together by a company name only. See [Scaling: Hire a "Manager Trainer" as COO](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NtLurYDKUXqy2VHFWcw027sJhHPCwsatV2GaVF4jebk/edit)

Certain areas require functional expertise: Legal, Engineering, Finance/Accounting. But do not be fooled that when you hire an experienced lawyer as your General Counsel, a skilled engineer as your VP Engineering, and an experienced accountant or investment banker as your CFO, that you are also hiring an excellent manager. It is a rare case when you are doing so.

In addition, existing team members are entirely known quantities. You see if they exhibit the behaviors you want (culture), whether they understand the details of your business, and whether you plain like them. External hires are rarely a perfect culture match, often take months if not years to truly understand your business, and if you end up not liking them personally you will not spend the necessary time with them to fully train them on how you want them to operate.

I coach many highly successful late-stage companies. When I ask the CEOs who their top exec team members are, the names that I hear are often promoted internally.

So, before you hire external executives, build a manager training program. If you have to hire externally for a person to run this program, so be it. Give them the title COO. Make it clear that their primary job function is to train all of the company's managers.

This function was Sheryl Sandberg's gift to Facebook. You deserve the same.
