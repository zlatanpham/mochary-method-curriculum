[Board Meeting \- Best Practice](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WDGVUYHPyQGHjcIVpqQP9dRjABWjU_VoVdtMDdtNDOk/edit)

The best board meeting is one that gives board members enough information to allow them to be helpful to you. Be transparent. Be vulnerable. If you do, the board will reward you with rich and valuable feedback.

Here are my board meeting best practices:

1. Share the board meeting information with all board members in writing at least 3 days (but preferably 7 days) in advance of the meeting.

   1. Format: Memo or deck. With a short video.

      1. My preference is a memo, as it lends itself more to reading.

      2. Some CEOs are now starting to include short Loom videos (less than 5 minutes) that run through all of the most important ideas in the memo. Board members LOVE this as they can watch at 1.5x speed.

         1. This replaces the CEO’s opening walk-through in the board meeting itself.

   2. Information included:

      1. Update

         1. KPIs, including
            1. Summary Financials
            2. Product Roadmap
            3. Hiring Roadmap
            4. Sales Pipeline
         2. What we accomplished last quarter (OKRs)
         3. For each KPIs and OKRs
            1. Green, yellow, red label (on track, off track, far off track)
            2. The good
            3. The not good
               1. And what we are going to do to fix it
         4. What we hope to accomplish next quarter (OKRs)

      2. Issues

         1. One or two strategic questions or problems with which we are grappling. (Could be from the Update above.)

            1. The issue of choice written out thoroughly
            2. Our proposed solution

         2. Most board members have far more visibility than you as to what other companies have experienced when tackling forward-looking strategic questions or operations at other companies. I.e

            1. Should we expand to Europe?
            2. Should we launch an adjacent product?
            3. Have other companies done layoffs and what have their experiences been with it?

         3. By contrast, you have much more context than your board members on internal operating issues. I.e.

            1. Our CMO is struggling, what should we do?

         4. Stick to the questions where your board has more visibility than you do.

      3. Requests
         1. Specific action requests of board members
            1. Most board members have strong networks. Take advantage of this by asking for warm introductions to potential customers, partners, etc.
      4. Feedback
         1. Ask the board:
            1. How could this board meeting be more effective?
            2. How could I (as CEO) be more effective?

   3. Collect responses
      1. Ask board members to pose questions and write responses to the board packet at least two days before the meeting.

2. During the next 48 hours, you, or your internal team, write up answers to all board member questions.

3. Meet (phone call) with board members 1-1 just before the board meeting to

   1. Ensure that they have ingested the information

4. Elicit their questions, concerns, etc., so that they come to the board meeting already feeling heard (this is critical for creating trust).

5. At the board meeting

   1. Cause everyone to get present for the meeting.

      1. I like to start with a short exercise to get everyone in a positive mood and have us know each other a bit more as humans.
         1. Each board member shares one fun thing (in 30 seconds or less) that they have experienced since the last board meeting.
         2. If there are more than 6 people present, the verbal sharing becomes too long. In that case, I limit the sharing to only board members, not observers, lawyers nor execs. And if there are more than 6 board members, then I skip this.

   2. Answer the questions received about the board packet.

   3. Invite the executive team to attend. This allows board members and executives to get to know each other and gain comfort with each other.

      1. Each exec will have contributed to the board memo. You can offer each 2-3 minutes to give a verbal summary of their department update.

      2. Allow the execs to participate in the strategic issue discussion (below).

   4. Unpack one strategic question or issue.

      1. Ask for each board member's view. Give equal air time.
         1. If your board members are willing to write, use [Issue / Proposed Solution template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10JEFVl3pEk7HUT82oM3LbHtP8hRQvlzK9SQyuJFMyCo/edit)
      2. Allow Board observers and lawyers to write, but not to speak unless you specifically ask for their input.

   5. Unpack the second issue.

   6. Confirm that each board member is willing to do the actions requested.

   7. Closed-door session.

      1. Ask that all non-board members leave the room, leaving only board members and the lawyer.

      2. _Collect written feedback if it wasn't already collected in response to the board packet._

6. Closing ceremony: to remind each other that we're on the same team

   1. For this, I like to have each board member thank one other person in the room for something that they did. Once a person is thanked, they can’t be thanked again (so that everyone gets thanked for something). The CEO thanks last, since she has something to thank each person about.

7. Social time

   1. It is often healthy to create an informal social venue for board members and the executive team. This is usually a meal before or after the meeting.

      1. Board observers and lawyers are usually not invited to this gathering.
