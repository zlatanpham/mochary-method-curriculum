[Sadness: how to process it](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jyTa5H_fo9xL-EhUQGsqQkUAqG4zVxAok0JwNCjiBFU/edit) (2 min)

Each of us feels sadness (or fear feeling sadness in the future) at some time in our life. When we do, we have two choices:

1. To let the sadness out by giving it full expression (full-on wailing crying, which rarely lasts longer than 1 minute).

2. To not let the sadness have full expression and, therefore, have it sit somewhere deep inside us.

We often feel a cathartic release if we do the former, and the sadness no longer grips us. For this reason, most funeral services are designed to create maximum crying. The Catholic Church seems to be particularly good at this with its use of open caskets.

If we do the latter, the sadness often becomes a depressive (and very long-lasting) mood.

I highly recommend the former.

Almost all sadness comes from the death of something (or the fear of the end of something): a person, a relationship, or a vision of how my world would be.

So, to fully mourn that death, I would like to create a memorial service.

- I go to a quiet place where I can be alone and not heard (a car is often good for this).

- I get myself into a state where I can access my sadness. I do this by watching a sentimental video clip that gets my tears flowing (here is a [good example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bL9KEaike8U&fbclid=IwAR1whYdngSKlAPkkrrzQMmFA4Py8aJ2Fm9vvlHv_y7yvUxrSViVfi5fZpfI)).

- I close my eyes and envision a full funeral service for the death of the thing that I am mourning.

- I allow the tears to flow fully and don't try to stop them until they stop on their own accord.

When I do this faithfully, I find that sadness no longer grips me, and the feeling of joy and curiosity returns. My brain and my life begin to function again.

I also find it helpful to realize that sadness is merely proof of love. If I didn't love something, I wouldn't feel sad when it was gone. So, to me, sadness is massively affirming. It is incontrovertible proof that I love.

I, therefore, believe that we should celebrate sadness. It is both cathartic and affirming.
