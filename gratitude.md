## [Gratitude](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18kCULxudhpoSZNN-5m4G611YGNI92aZA-xrMjbF0juA/edit#) (3 min)

Confirmation bias is the phenomenon that we will discover evidence to support whatever belief we start with. A corollary to this is that whatever question we ask, we will focus on the answer.

In any situation, we can ask ourselves, "What is wrong here?" or "What is right here?" Throughout our lives, parents, teachers, and employers have taught us to ask the former question. We cannot fault them. They had the best intentions. In the earliest years of our life, they were trying to keep us alive. Unfortunately, an unintended consequence is that we learned to focus on the negative, so we continually see the negative. This leads to objectively very successful people being not fully satisfied with their lives, themselves, etc. If that is where it ended, I wouldn't touch it, as this book is about becoming a great CEO, not about maximizing a feeling of fulfillment. However, that is not where it ends.

It turns out that we perform our best when we are having fun and feeling good about ourselves.

If you want proof of this, go to any kid sports event where you know the kids' names. Start cheering positively for the losing team, with specific compliments to specific kids: "Great pass Jimmy." "Way to be in position, George." When a kid takes a shot but misses … "Good idea Joey, it was the right thing to do." Within 5-10 minutes, the game's tide will start to change toward the team that you are giving specific compliments to. (I have done this many times. And it has worked every time\!)

So, how do we take advantage of this knowledge to generate a good feeling in ourselves? We ask the right question: "What is good about this situation?" "What is good about this team member?" "What is good about my company?" "What is good about my life?" Or, we fill in the overarching statement: "**I am grateful for \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_."**

I recommend making this a daily practice. I do it first thing every morning. To remember to do it, create a trigger for yourself.

A trigger is something that you will see at the time that you want to do the action. The most effortless trigger, in this case, is a piece of paper with the word "Gratitude" printed on it, taped to your night-table, or wall by your bed, or mirror in your bathroom. When you see it each morning, you say the phrase "I am grateful for \_\_" five times with a different ending each time. (You don't have to say it out loud; you can say it in your mind.) Using a trigger allows you to create a habit easily.

Another way to make this a regular habit is to use a journal like [The Five-Minute Journal](https://www.amazon.com/Five-Minute-Journal-Happier-Minutes/dp/0991846206/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1531248905&sr=8-2&keywords=five+minute+journal). Keeping the book by your bedside is the trigger, as you will see it when you wake up and just before you go to sleep.

If you do this gratitude practice regularly (don't worry if you miss days here and there), your view of your life and yourself will begin to change for the better. And soon afterward, you will start to perform better in life, just like the kids on the sports field.

For the cynics out there, being grateful doesn't mean that you will suddenly ignore all of the areas of your life or your company that could use improvement. Just the opposite. It only means that you will bring an attitude of joy instead of desperation when addressing those areas.

Life and company-building don't have to be complicated or painful. Daily gratitude helps us realize that.
