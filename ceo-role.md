#### The CEO role is typically thought of as ...

- Set and communicate the vision, mission, values, and quarterly OKRs of the company

- Ensure the Product is solving the current and future problems of the customer (by continually talking to existing and potential customers).

- Create and maintain positive relationships with key stakeholders: investors, customers, partners, employees.

- Report to the board and investors

- Hire and manage the exec team

  - Hold and run regular 1-1s and team meetings.

  - Cause each department to create OKRs for their department, teams, and individuals.

  - Hold each person accountable for achieving their quarterly OKRs.

- Ensure that the hiring bar is maintained high and consistent with company values.

- Ensure that resource allocation (compensation and budget) is given according to priority and merit (not the squeaky wheel).

- Putting out fires that occur. These usually erupt at the fault lines between departments that must work together (Sales and Marketing, Product and Engineering).

- Run any department for which a department head has not yet been hired.

These are indeed CEO responsibilities. But it doesn't mean that they all need to get done by the CEO. The CEO must ensure that they all get done by someone. And hopefully by someone passionate about that function. Because I posit that **only someone who loves a function can be truly good at it**, that includes you. If you are not passionate about any of these functions, you will not be good at them.

Most CEOs I coach are product visionaries. They both love and are excellent at:

- Set and communicate the vision, mission, values, and quarterly OKRs of the company

- Ensure the Product is solving the current and future problems of the customer (by continually talking to existing and potential customers).

There are three functions that, unfortunately, cannot be outsourced:

- Create and maintain positive relationships with key stakeholders: employees, partners, customers, and investors.

- Report to the board and investors

- Hire the exec team

- Future visioning of the company and its products

Someone else, however, can do the remainder:

- Manage the exec team

  - Hold and run regular 1-1s and team meetings.

  - Cause each department to create OKRs for their department, teams, and individuals.

  - Hold each person accountable for achieving their quarterly OKRs.

  - Putting out fires that occur. These usually erupt at the fault lines between departments that must work together (Sales and Marketing, Product and Engineering).

- Ensure that the hiring bar is maintained high and consistent with company values.

- Ensure that resource allocation (compensation and budget) is given according to priority and merit (not the squeaky wheel).

- Run any department for which a department head has not yet been hired.

In my view, the CEO should only do those functions of the role that she loves to do. The rest she should outsource to someone else who does love them. An easy catch-all is to onboard a COO/President or [Chief of Staff](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-tcubUwvktoV-Ou3bB6ynk2LLwNzdT3D_p_ILreyR_A/edit) (2 min). After 90 days, they will likely be able to do any of the roles that you do not love.

#### When to fire me as CEO?

If you are completely burned out, or the things that you don't love about the CEO role include people management, hiring, sales, and fundraising (the only thing you love is Product), then its likely time to fire yourself and hire a CEO rather than a CoS or COO.

Why? Because large customers, investors, and senior executives on your team want to have a direct and ongoing relationship with the person whose title is CEO (i.e., the perceived decision-maker). If you don't want to have those relationships, you have to give the title to the person who will.

And then name yourself Chairman. Go off and build your ideal life. The joke is that you still get to own all of your equity, that equity will become even more valuable, and you get to build yourself an ideal life.
