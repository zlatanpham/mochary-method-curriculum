In addition to those techniques, I recommend coaching each team member to help them achieve an environment that allows them to feel joy and therefore produce their best work.

I ask my reports the following sets of questions once a month in our 1-1, where 1 is "it couldn't be any worse," 5 is "it couldn't be any better," and 3 is "meeting expectation":

- How are you feeling about your life at work, 1-5?
- What is your 5 year career vision?
  - Is what you are doing now at work leading you toward your 5 year career vision, 1-5?
- How are you feeling about your personal life, 1-5?
- How are you feeling about your Work From Home (WFH) setup, 1-5?
- How are we performing as a company, 1-5?
- What is it like to work with the rest of the team, 1-5?
- What is it like to work with me, 1-5?

- For the lowest category …

  - What would get it to the next level?

- If unpacking personal life, please rate these categories, 1-5:

  - Relationship
  - Home
  - Career
  - Money
  - Time with friends and family
  - Fun and entertainment
  - Physical Health
  - Mind and Soul

- For the lowest category …
  - What would get it to the next level?

I read through the entire list. To improve Work Life, Personal Life, WFH and “Work with the rest of the team” usually require actions from the person. So, from these categories, I pick the lowest rated one. I ask the person to share more with me verbally. And then I help them formulate a very specific action plan to take that category to the next level. I then track those actions in our Agreement-Tracker. (I usually don’t unpack a second category, unless it feels that the person has the capacity to handle more tasks.)

I then pick the lowest rated category among the remaining: Company Performance and “Working with me”, as those usually require actions from me. I ask the person to share more with me verbally. And then I ask them to help me formulate a very specific action plan to take that category to the next level. I then track those actions in our Agreement-Tracker.

I ask these same questions (in writing) **once per month** for each team member. Over time, each will rise until all are 4 or above. And then magic usually happens.

Even if I don't succeed in creating a perfect 5 environment, my team feels very heard and cared for, simply because I ask the questions and cause them to think about it. In particular, the question about personal life ("How are you feeling about your life overall, 1-5?") seems to unlock a lot of joy, which in turn boosts workplace productivity and loyalty. People feel honored that I care enough about them to help them tangibly improve their personal life.

For those team members who have high variability in motivation, I ask a further set of questions:

- On your list of actions, what are you excited to work on?
- On your list of actions, what are you not excited to work on?

For the actions that they are excited about, nothing needs to be done. They will crush those.

For each action that they are not excited about, I ask them which bucket it falls into:

1. Doesn't need to be done

2. Needs to be done, but someone else can do it.

   1. Who could do it?

3. Needs to be done, and only you can do it.

   1. What conditions would make it pleasant for you to do it? i.e., You would enjoy doing this action as long as …

      1. One trick that often works to make an unpleasant task less unpleasant is to do the task while co-working with someone else. So, I offer to have a co-working session with them. I work on the actions that I don't relish but am the only one who can do them. They work on their similar set. I find that we both get a lot done without feeling any pain.

I have found that it only takes a few months for each team member to start answering 4/5 (most people hold back on giving a 5 because things could always be better, even if they don't know how) about their work life, their home life, how we are operating as a company, and my interaction with them. And when that happens, their productivity shoots through the roof.

When I take the next step and make sure that each person works primarily on things that excite them, the fireworks begin.

Suddenly, a very small team can produce an immense amount of work. And the benefits of that … well, hopefully, you already know.
