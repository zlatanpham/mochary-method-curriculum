[How to quit 1:1s]()

## **Why Quit 1:1s?**

Inspired by leaders like [Jensen Huang (Nvidia)](https://youtu.be/No8XWKx-gQg?si=etLGYt2wQyzeEa6A) and [Brian Chesky (Airbnb)](https://x.com/asanwal/status/1856549582332727471), many of our CEOs have eliminated 1:1 meetings. The reasons are clear:

- **Time-consuming and inefficient:** Hours per week, often low-value for CEO
- **Lack of transparency:** Siloed information, others miss valuable insights
- **Missed learning opportunities:** Only one person benefits from feedback, rather than whole team
- **Slows decision-making:** key stakeholders aren’t present, delaying key decisions
- **Energy drain:** Becomes a “therapy session” where employees vent about problems, instead of focusing on solutions

## **The Alternative: Group 1-1s**

Instead of individual meetings, bring all direct reports into a single group meeting. This saves time, increases efficiency, and fosters shared learning across leadership.

- **Saves time and energy** by consolidating discussions.
- **Ensures shared learning** – when someone gets feedback, everyone benefits.
- **Facilitates cross-functional problem-solving** – silos are eliminated.
- **Creates real-time decision-making** with all key stakeholders present.

## **How to handle feedback in a group**

One-on-ones have traditionally been used for private feedback. Initially this can feel risky or uncomfortable in a group setting. But feedback is more valuable when shared. The key is building the capability on the team to give and receive feedback openly by making it structured and predictable.

**Building a feedback culture**

- **Start with yourself.** Show the team how to receive feedback by modeling [the 5As](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zsVOnpNayriDpzgjJUDO2n47YxO9EAXbVH2uC_Zpnms/edit?tab=t.0)
- **Reward and encourage**: the most “gut punchy” critique from your team.

- ## **Emphasize shared learning**: when one person receives feedback, everyone benefits from it.

- **Use [absolute feedback](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Lr0sZSVS2eGq9UC7-twTXsmqczZCXf4PV21kCqoh2n4/edit?pli=1&tab=t.0) model:** Structured, fast and effective in a group.

**Structured Feedback Round-Robin**  
To ensure consistent feedback without overwhelming the team, use a rotating feedback cycle:

1. Week 1: **CEO receives feedback** from the entire team (using absolute feedback).
2. Week 2: **CEO gives feedback** to each executive.
3. Week 3: **One executive receives feedback** from peers (except the CEO)
4. Week 4: **Another executive receives feedback** from peers.

With this repeating cycle, the CEO gives and receives monthly feedback. Every executive receives quarterly feedback from their peers.

## **Bringing issues to the group meeting**

Normally in 1-1s, bring up specific issues and challenges. Instead, in a weekly group meeting:

- Executives bring issues to the team, not just the CEO.
- Encourages cross-functional collaboration and alignment.
- Even unrelated departments can provide valuable solutions or insights.
- Utilize the [Issue, Proposed-Solution (IPS)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Hn_E1UFYruM1sXATsSwIydIJ4EsxMvxlnyoypOVRb_M/edit?tab=t.0) framework

Optional: Goals can be part of this meeting, or handled separately in a [“Top Goals” meeting](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jpzy6_ix1y9n0OPnZ-b7Nu-9biH_qQMPCN2WeqeIgR0/edit?tab=t.0) where teams can help unblock project leaders.

## **How to maintain connection without individual 1-1s**

One-on-ones often include informal relationship-building, but this can be done separately:

- Quarterly dinners, lunches, or coffee chats: create personal connection outside of structured meetings.
- Virtual coffee chats for remote teams – keep the casual check-ins without the recurring calendar bloat.
- Walking meetings or casual meetups – build relationships in a low-pressure setting.

---

## **Handling private issues**

## Some topics still require privacy, like personal hardships or sensitive matters. To address this without defaulting to weekly one-on-ones:

- ## **Offer a weekly office hour** for personal or confidential discussions (rarely used)

- ## **Encourage direct outreach** people can call, message, or book time directly for personal issues
