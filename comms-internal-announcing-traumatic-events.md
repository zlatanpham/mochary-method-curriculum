[Comms, Internal: Announcing traumatic events](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14HaKYEnw4ec--oL_vPKCRK8ognGbzkc8BzfA6_aIpfo/edit)

Whether you let go of a single senior executive or lay off 30% of the company, it is a trauma to the organization. Anytime a "negative" occurrence like this happens, those that remain naturally ask themselves the question, "Am I next?" and they feel fear. This anxiety is not motivating but instead causes people to spend time and energy trying to figure out what is going on (talking to each other about this), creating other options (interviewing with other companies), etc. If the fear is allowed to fester, many will actually leave to get to a place of stability. All of this creates a tremendous downward pull on productivity. Therefore, your primary goal should be to minimize the feeling of fear in the organization.

And the best way to minimize fear is to ... acknowledge it\!

First, know that any trauma, whether small or large, takes time for the organization to heal from.

Usually 2-3 months. And if a new trauma occurs before the organization has had time to heal from the last one fully, then organizational PTSD may well set in.

Many CEOs ask: "If I know that I will need to let go many people, is it better for me to drip out the terminations through rolling performance reviews, or should I terminate all at once?" The answer from me is an unequivocal "all at once." Make it one trauma and begin the healing process, rather than a never-ending series of concussions from which the org cannot heal.

Second, know that when a traumatic event happens, a moment of trust or distrust happens. If you try to hide the fact that it occurred (make no announcement) or blame the people leaving, then the remainder of the org will lose trust in you. If, however, you announce the trauma to all, take responsibility for the fact that these people are leaving (i.e., "I hired too many people too fast"), and put real time and effort into helping every terminated employee land a fantastic next job, then the org will gain significant trust in you.

Third, when the org does feel fear (as it will when you announce the RIF), the best way that I know to alleviate it is:

- The first time a person learns that they are being let go, it is in a 1-1. (Therefore schedule many 1-1s back to back with those being let go. It is OK for each of these meetings to last only 10 minutes, and therefore to schedule them every 15 minutes.) This is step 1\.

  - In these 1-1s, share that you will schedule a longer follow-up where

    - They will sign their offboarding documents and receive their severance pay.

    - You will be their agent in finding their next job, if they are open to your help. See [Firing Well (updated)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1J3c8lGMzPJXMMSWNIh7UCsv-_4qKYZkrkwloIbu3BW8/edit) for the details.

- Make sure that all of the remaining team members (the Stay Team) have the same information … a thorough announcement in an All Hands Meeting after the termination 1-1s have occurred.

- Ensure that each person can vent their emotions … a 1-1 with their manager within 24 hours of learning about the trauma. Cause each remaining team member to have a 1-1 with their manager within 24 hours of the All Hands Meeting.

  - During this 1-1, the manager should ask the team member to share their feelings and thoughts. The manager should not seek to defend or justify the company's actions but rather hear and acknowledge the team member's thoughts.

  - If the team member is unwilling to share anything juicy, the manager can say, "I imagine you are thinking …" and then supply a juicy thought that the team member might plausibly be thinking (i.e., "our CEO is a cold bastard"). Exaggerate the thought to the negative. If you do, it implicity permits the team member to express their less radical views. The team member will usually respond: "Yeah, something like that, but not that strong." or "Not that, but what I am thinking is …."

  - Once the team member expresses their thought, the manager can show that they have heard by simply saying, "I think I heard you say …" and then summarizing what the team member said. Do this until the team member states, "That's right." Then the team member will feel heard, and this will dissipate much of their anger and fear.

Fourth, do not have the terminated employees remain at the company any longer than is absolutely necessary. If you are terminating them for cause, they will often be bitter and toxic during these post-termination days. If they were terminated because of a layoff, they will remind everyone of their sadness at their departure. Either way, it is healthier to start fresh with the new team as soon as possible.

Fifth, word about the termination will likely spread. If it is newsworthy, a reporter will write about it and use it as proof that your company is failing. If you want to get ahead of this story, write it yourself and publish it before anyone else can write about it. Make it juicy enough that any other hit piece will be a darker shade of grey than what you wrote, and therefore not new enough to be worth writing.

Lastly, the exact timing of making the announcement has several possible paths, each with its plus and minuses. I will discuss two here:

1\. Managers announce the terminations in 1-1s before the AHM for the “stay team.”

Plus:

- The first time a terminated employee learns of the termination, they get 1-1 attention from their manager.
- The first-time non-terminated employees attend an AHM; you assure them that they are part of the go-forward team.  
  Minus:
- The entire team does not have the same information at the same time.

2\. An AHM happens first. You inform everyone of the "why" of the terminations. You invite those who are terminated to a 1-1 in the morning. A second AHM happens in the afternoon for the “stay team.”

Plus:

- The entire team has the same information at the same time.  
  Minus:
- If you announce the terminations at the AHM (i.e., who has a 1-1 already scheduled in the morning), they will likely express their sadness and anger to their teammates while they await the 1-1.
- If you do not announce the terminations at the AHM (i.e., Managers come and get the next terminated person for a 1-1), then all will fear during the morning hours, not knowing if they will be next.

There is no correct answer between these paths. Just be aware of the Plus and Minus of each.

Here, therefore, is my preferred timeline:

1. Preparation. These steps to happen very close together:

   1. The executive team decides broad strokes of who they will terminate.
   2. Ask managers to give specific recommendations.
   3. The executive team makes the final list.
   4. Managers set up 1-1s with all of their stay team members for Day 2\.
   5. Schedule the terminations for the morning of Day 1\.
   6. Schedule All Hands meetings for those who are staying for the afternoon of Day One.

2. These next steps are all to happen back-to-back in a total of 1-3 days:

   1. Day 0: Inform all managers who will be let go.
   2. Day 1:

      1. All Hands Meeting

         1. State what you are doing
         2. State why you are doing it
         3. State that those with 1-1s in the morning are being let go, those in the afternoon are remaining.
         4. Thank every person for their service, and assure them that you will spend real time making sure that they land softly … and then do it\!
         5. Acknowledge the fear and anger that people are likely feeling
            1. "You may well be thinking …
               1. Our CEO is a cold bastard.
               2. This is totally unnecessary. The economy will rebound in a few months, and these layoffs will have been totally unnecessary."
            2. If you want to address each of these fears and what you will do about them, great. But know that you don't have to. The key is simply acknowledging them.

      2. Every manager meets 1-1 with every team member who is leaving.

         1. The manager commits to spending real-time helping them find their next role (and must follow through on this).
         2. The manager listens to and acknowledges the team member's feelings and thoughts.
         3. Create an alumni Slack channel.
            1. If you don't do it, they will. And you won't like the results if they create it on their own.
            2. Be in the channel and actively help alumni solve their problems.

      3. All Hands Meeting with all of the remaining team to announce what is happening.
         1. State what you are doing
         2. State why you are doing it
         3. Express deep gratitude for all that has been done by both those that are leaving and those that remain.
         4. Acknowledge the fear and anger that people are likely feeling
            1. "You may well be thinking …
               1. Am I next?
               2. Our CEO is a cold bastard.
               3. This is totally unnecessary. The economy will rebound in a few months, and these layoffs will have been totally unnecessary."
            2. If you want to address each of these fears and what you will do about them, great. But know that you don't have to. The key is simply acknowledging them.
         5. State the go-forward Vision for the company. Who is the new customer, what is their problem, and how will you solve it.  


3. Publish your article about the layoffs on Medium, LinkedIn, Twitter, etc.  

4. Day 2, every manager meets 1-1 with all the remaining team members to vent their feelings and thoughts in the afternoon.
   1. The manager listens to and acknowledges the team member's feelings and thoughts using [Heard: how to make people feel it](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NiCEEUO2-38pIVGM7nrnpGRykbbtv2xuqLoKW50ZzLw/edit) (2 min).

Reading this, if you are the CEO, you are likely feeling fear, especially if you have never done a layoff before. You may be thinking the following:

- "The press is going to write that we are failing."
- "I can't bear to let all these people go who are really good and were so hard to recruit. It will take me so much effort to rehire their equal again later."
- "Some of these people are single mothers with small children. I will be putting them out on the street."
- "They will hate me."

All of these are legitimate thoughts. Their intent is positive … to keep you safe. But know that they are likely exaggerations. The reality is possible that:

- If you write your press, the story will be over.
- When you get leaner, the company will operate even more efficiently. And then when you do rehire, you will rehire even better people.
- Those who are in dire economic circumstances, you will help to land a great position. And they may well be even better off then.
- If you are transparent, take responsibility for the situation, and genuinely help each laid-off person find a new position, then you will likely be respected and appreciated.

Remember that Jack Welch is remembered as the greatest CEO of all time. And he was a one-trick pony. All he did was let go of the bottom 10% of GE each year and overcompensate the top 20%. That's it. Brutal, but highly effective.

You can remove the brutality by putting real effort into helping those let go find a soft landing.
