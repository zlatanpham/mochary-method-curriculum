[Make Money, Have Fun, Do Good](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1P_8WALoefgBCQ9cR0Jgwztt_8-ppjJ1r7zpeyoikTa0/edit?folder=0B9tanFUuwmYSMHIyU2pkYTZSVkU) (2 min)

When I joined Spectrum Equity Investors after business school, many friends and friends of friends began reaching out to me for career advice. The ploy was a thin one. They wanted a job at Spectrum. There was no such job available to them, but I earnestly gave them career advice. They each said they wanted a position where they could "make money, have fun and do good." I replied: "Great, but if you had to choose just one of those, which would it be?" The answer was inevitably: "Make money." I then told them to optimize only for that variable. If they tried to optimize for all three, they'd end up in a place that provided none.

After giving this advice over and over, I realized that I needed to follow it myself. So I started my own company, and 18 months later, I was lucky enough to have amassed more wealth than I knew what to do with.

Having checked the box of Make Money, I could now turn my attention to Have Fun. I made it my full-time job. And I became very good at it. I did it for three years straight until I had had so much fun that I was over it.

Now what? Well, Do Good seemed the next logical step. And to me, this didn't mean giving money to charities. It meant doing the really dirty work: Helping people that others were afraid to. To me, that meant helping hard-core criminals in the US. And that's when I decided to set up the Mochary Foundation.

The problem that I discovered was this: Millions of formerly incarcerated Americans struggle to get jobs because every employer can easily do a background check, and the vast majority of employers will not hire someone with a criminal record if there is another candidate available. That leaves formerly incarcerated people with almost no way of making legitimate money. But they still need to eat. So, they do whatever they have to in order to eat. And this often leads them right back to prison.

The solution, in my opinion, is a short vocational training program for high-skill jobs for which there is a shortage of qualified candidates. At the [Mochary Foundation](https://www.mochary.org/), this is what we do: train x-convicts to get their Commercial Driver's License. Within days of getting their license, they are usually driving a truck for over $50,000/year, and suddenly their future seems stable and tenable. And then they want to help the next x-convict by paying back the cost of their training, plus the cost of two more. This makes the whole operation self-funding.

I very much enjoyed the feeling of success in making money. That good feeling lasted about a week. Then I very much enjoyed having fun. I was good at it, and it lasted for years. But when I finally started to change lives by doing good, I felt something that I'd never felt before: deep satisfaction. And it is the best feeling that I have ever experienced.

It is a feeling that I wish upon you. And if you know that you will eventually get there, there is no reason to wait as I did.

You can start the ball rolling sooner by having your company do [Pledge 1%](https://pledge1percent.org/) or personally doing [Founder's Pledge](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_GDBxCHP6LTqy-OciTw5Ox1YoIGYnfnbkdnlUhzhWkg/edit?folder=0B9tanFUuwmYSMHIyU2pkYTZSVkU). Or both\! You will not regret it. And your action will be leveraged, as it will be an inspiration to others.
